AU Danny/Tim; NC-17, memories and mentions of m/m and m/f sex, with some outsider angst thrown in, violence, injury, kidnapping and character death. Oh, and swearing.
<p>

I hate Sundays. The hatred goes way back, back when I was woken up every morning to the sound of church bells. It wouldn't be so bad, but being it was the Sabbath, I would insist on staying up late and reading. All the stores and moving picture theaters my mother would not let me go to on Saturday would be closed on Sunday. My playmates would never be around to play, since they were all in church. All there was left to do was read, torment Richard (which lead him to tormenting me) and go into empty fields and play with the explosives.
<p>
At gymnasium, it became worse. The dorms were often empty, while everyone was at church, then families and dinner. My family was far away, so I was alone in a school I was only in because of my high entrance exam scores. The head of my dormitory looked the other way when I sneaked out for cigarettes and some open coffee house. Sometimes, I would walk in the local cemetery, looking at all the pious headstones and wonder where they really gone. Probably they are decaying in the ground. That wasn't the end, though. Every busybody worried about the corruption of youth would ask me why I wasn't at church. I even got into a couple of fistfights with some Nazis offended by my very presence on the streets on a Sunday. The logical question of why they weren't in church only started the fists flying.
<p>
I never really complained about it to my parents in my letters. My troubles seemed so small compared to what they and their parents went through. Pogroms, prejudice against the Ostjuden and the trials of becoming teachers seemed much bigger than what I was going through. They were hoping for Richard and me to have better lives. I almost believed we would.
<p>
The last year I was in Berlin, before the election, before the expulsions and the restrictions, I saw Herr Professor Acker sneak out of the crowd going to church. He beckoned me to follow, and I did, walking beside him. I would catch the strangest things, like the gray hairs in his brown hair and beard, the crow's feet on his face, and his broad shoulders. I remember blushing, realizing I was admiring another man, the same way my classmates and I would admire a pretty girl. In fact, I stared at him in class sometimes, forgetting to take notes. What was I doing, I wondered. I was a boy making high marks, but I did not know what to do.
<p>
In his room, he kisses hesitant and reverent. He pulls back, staring at my confused look. "I'm sorry, Daniel, if you don't want this--"
<p>
I kissed him back, and confess, "I do not know what to do, Herr Professor." Dirty jokes, holding hands with girls, a waltz where I tried to feel her up, I know; but with someone older, and a man, I know not.
<p>
"Lie down," he said in a calm whisper, "just let me admire you."
<p>
As bells for the service ending rung, I was naked on his bed, with Acker licking and kissing me all over. I saw I was blushing all over. In between, he would tell me how handsome I was, how he loved my muscles, pale skin and red hair. I was drunk on his admiration, on the new sensation of a mouth on my skin and on having Sunday actually being bearable. He wouldn't always sneak out of church, but I was so happy when he did. My rational mind laughed at his murmurings of fairy blood, but I wanted him. I even entertained silly notions of running away with him.
<p>
Then he got engaged and stopped seeing me on Sundays. Sundays weren't just days of isolation, but also grief. I met Isolde at a birthday party. She never went to school, working in her parents' store. She would sneak strong drink from her father, run to the fields with me, get drink and neck. Sometimes we would get drunk, neck and argue. We came very close to either killing each other or losing our virginity many times.
<p>
I would never see her on Sundays, though; she never missed church. On those Sundays, I would sit in my dormitory and ask if I really loved her. I hated the answer that always came: no. There was lust and distraction, but love died before I met her.
<p>
The week after I was expelled, she told me she was ready. We ran out into the field with a bottle of red wine she snuck out. Naked, she climbed up on top of me, rocking back and forth, like they did in the blue books we snuck around to read. I compared the sensation of fucking a cunt to being sucked off. The feeling was more diffuse, it felt softer and I can relax more, just watching her rock back and forth with her golden brown hair covering her face. I don't know if she was enjoying herself, though I see her shift to more comfortable positions while keeping me inside. I liked touching her tennis-strengthened arms and her small and round breasts, white against her tan arms and legs. She shuddered when my fingers, already callused from violin playing, brush against her nipples. Moving my fingers to her cunt made her whimper and rock even harder. Enough of her shifting made me gulp and jerk my hips, losing myself in her. Somewhere in the orgasmic haze, I thought, this is nice, but something is missing, but she is so nice, so I won't say it.
<p>
She rolled off me and took several deep breaths beside. She looked at me and said "I can't see you anymore, Danny, my mom and dad said being seen around a Jew will get me into trouble."
<p>
I screamed at her that she could have told me before we fucked, you lousy bitch with silly airs, acting so aristocratic when she was just a drunk daughter of a shopkeeper. 
<p>
She yelled what a rude and heartless little shit I was, don't I care if she goes to jail? Besides, she adds hoarsely, I was a bigger drunk than she was, drinking down a whole liter of brandy last time we were together as she put her clothes back on in haste. 
<p>
I just dressed, put back on my glasses, wiped the dirt and grass off of me and left for the moving picture theater, muttering a hearty "Fuck you, Isolde." In the distance, she yelled she only slept with me out of pity, you little head-in-the-clouds bookworm.
<p>
I wonder where she is now. Probably married with a passel of brats in her small and pretentious hometown. Maybe one of them is mine.
<p>
I never talked of either of them with Richard or the other players. I suppose because I think if I did, explusion would be entirely my fault. I would not be surprised if students who had done worst things were give another chance. Other students who weren't Jewish, that is.
<p>
In Paris, I mocked Sunday. In the afternoon, we would stage incoherent plays, often with me dressed as the devil tormenting some poor sap. That was long ago, when I was just relieved to be out of a bad situation. Then there was Tim. Sometimes, after church, Louise would fool around with Tim, then later on, with both of us. Being around them at night after performances was soothing.
<p>
Now, I'm in a threadbare coat and riding cap in the middle of a Sunday church crowd, hoping no one notices we don't belong. 'We' is also Miriam, out on a pass to Paris from where she is living. Soon, she will leave her film composer position, concocting a story about getting married. She looks nervous or freezing in her kerchief and wool coat. With coal and petrol rationed, we all were freezing. Now, perhaps as a change of pace, crowds of people brave the freezing cold to go into an even colder church. Normal people scare me.
<p>
Just ignore us, I tell imaginary spies. Look at us, plain people in threadbare coats, going to church. Miriam holds her coat closer to her body and keeps looking at the crowd.
<p>
The Sunday crowd seemed like the best place to hide and exchange information. That is, if there aren't any pigeons in this flock of birds. Oh yes, you can never be too careful of informants.
<p>
For days, Vatos and Avila have tried to contact refugees in hiding, Louise tried to sweet talk genderamerie, and Miriam has combed underground newspapers. Tanya is rumored to have escaped, since no one got any word of which prison she was in. No word on whether they are held in offices or in prison. What if Christine or Bartek broke under torture? What if they identified us?
<p>
A break comes when Miriam tells of a friend. Meet her before church, she says. I am not sure what to look for, so I glance at every woman in the crowd. Horrifying possiblities come up: is she a double agent, has she been captured already, what if the information is false or outdated?
<p>
I see a woman brush against Miriam, her hair in a yellow kerchief, but she isn't even looking at us, so that couldn't be her. Miriam suddenly nods, holding out her hand. Then just as fast, she pulls it back. Was it her?
<p>
We keep walking, huddled against each other, among other men and women in old coats. Miriam leans over to me and murmurs "Here." I feel her hand go into my pocket. When I rummage through, I feel a slip of paper.
<p>

"We got to find some place to talk," I whisper to Miriam.
<p>

"We could always go in the church." I raise my eyebrows. Not in there. "Oh, come on, Danny, it will look even more suspicious if we're not."
<p>

"How can we talk in church? Don't you think it's holy and all that?"
<p>

"It doesn't stop people from talking."
<p>

"Will we stay long?"
<p>

"We'll duck out when it's Communion. You're not Catholic and I haven't
confessed since I was sixteen, so we're not staying."
<p>

"That's the bread and wine thing, right? When Tim told me about it, I thought it was a really strange version of a Sabbath dinner, just bread and wine but no other food."
<p>

"In a way, it is." She shrugs and looks up at the sky.
<p>

I whisper, "What was that for?"
<p>

"Checking to see if lightening is going to hit us out of the clear blue sky."
<p>

That Mme. Cutler, such a joker. Perhaps it will come when I take the bread and wine. I haven't eaten all morning and my supper was a cup of watery soup. We try to stretch and share our food, but the rations get stricter and the shopkeepers report more fake ration coupons. We do what we can, but most of us have the familiar hollowness in our stomach most of the day.
<p>

Miriam and I take a back pew, next to some elderly women and a young man
just putting out his cigarette. Fuck, I need one. I bet he's a collaborator.
Perhaps Miriam thinks so too, because she moves us further away from him.
<p>

I take a book from a pew and start reading. It has an explanation in French,
but all the text is Latin. Great, Latin wasn't my favorite language. I was good at it, but I was much more in love with Greek and more familiar with French.
<p>

I grab the slip of paper in my pocket and slide in between the pages of the book. It's the address in a decent part of Paris. Miriam told me the story yesterday. There is a girl living with bureaucrat from Munich. He apparently kept records on busker raids, processing paperwork on who was Resistance. One of those raids captured Bartek, Christine and Tatiana.
<p>

People say that the women never looked more beautiful than they do this winter. Hunger has made their calves lean, the lack of sun made their skin pale and their dresses are even more lovely made by their hands and mended with care. However, they perfer a full meal to the glances of men, though they will take both.
<p>

Some of them have taken both from the very people who are starving us.
<p>

I smooth the slip of paper out, staring at words I vaguely understand. "I'm going."
<p>

Miriam looks over her book. "Pardon?"
<p>

"I'll do it." I'll get the records.
<p>

"What about, you know, him?" Vatos can break in, maybe Avila. I think that is who she is talking about.
<p>

"I can do it."
<p>

"What about-" Arrest? Torture? Miriam may not like me, but she might not hate me that much.
<p>

"I can speak it." The documents will be in German, and I can read it.
<p>

She nods.
<p>

As we duck and sneak out among the Communion lines. "You're crazy, Danny, utterly crazy. You can't do this all yourself."
<p>

I nod. "I'm bringing someone. He has a camera."
<p>

She nods, uncertainly still in her squinting eyes.
<p>

Sometime during his university years, Richard learned to break into houses. He was a popular man with the ladies, but not necessarily with their parents. So, he learned how to sneak in back doors and open windows to spend time with them. When I was home from school, he taught me these dubious skills. I did not know they would prove so useful years later.
<p>

A few days after the meeting with Miriam, I am at the address. Tim is behind me, holding a bag close to him. He brings his camera, but he has packed in some brushes and a sketchpad. He hopes to sketch? He is either a fool or an optimist. I would say a fool.
<p>

The house is in a cul-de-sac, and I see no gendarme around here. I walk to a window and give it a push with my thumb. I sigh when I find it locked. I try the other windows and nothing.
<p>

I'm standing by the door, wondering what I have to shake the lock open, when Tim pulls something from his bag. I can see they are brushes, but then he pulls off the bristles.
<p>

He catches me staring. "Lock-picks. Gift." He walks to the door and uses the lock-pick to open the door. I shake myself of my surprise fast enough to walk in the house after him.
<p>

The first thing I notice when I walk in? It's warm in here. After going from the steady, breezeless cold of the outside into the draftiness of the inside, it is a surprise. Of course, they can have as much coal as they need to keep it warm even when no one is home. The second thing I notice is the yellow and cream wallpaper. It is very nice and new wallpaper, and I suppose I would have some if I had the means. Papers lie on a coffee table
and on a desk in the front room. Tim nods to me and take one page, takes a picture of that, then handing it to me.
<p>

I look up at him. "What was that for?"
<p>

"German," he says with a shrug. Oh.
<p>

I start reading, and it is your standard log of arrests, and maybe a few assignments to internment camps and prisons. None of the names ring a bell. That will come later.
<p>

I pace around the ground floor, from front room to hallway to dining room to kitchen. Somewhere in my wanderings, I come to a dusty and dark stairwell. Beside it was a piano, simple and brown with a trace of dust on the keys. Perhaps there was a musician who lived here, or just someone who liked to play. Why was it in such a dark corner? The front room is big enough to have a piano there, so why was it here?
<p>

I want to play on it, but I have work to do, I remind myself. Besides, the neighbors will hear and call for the authorities. One hand holds the document I am translating, but the other moves toward the piano.
<p>

I could just play one note, I tell myself. No one will hear me. So I press one key. I am startled to hear what should be a middle C sound like a middle D sharp.
<p>

The notes hurt my ears and my sensibilities. Bad enough the woman is a collaborator, but does she and her tenant have so little regard for culture they do not even tune their piano?
<p>

Perhaps I am being too finicky and Berliner about this. Oh no, the Berliners do not consider me one of their own, so I am just finicky.
<p>

Fine, but it still makes me angry. I take a deep breath and go back to translating and pacing. I still come back to that damn piano.
<p>

I jerk my head when I hear footsteps. I move my hand close to my front, making my hand into a fist. The footsteps get louder, so I throw down the paper, turn around fast and throw a punch. I manage to see Tim duck down fast before the swing connects with his jaw.
<p>

I manage to catch my breath from the panic and growl "Don't sneak up behind me."
<p>

He tilts his head up. "So don't pace so much that I cannot catch up."
<p>

I frown, hating that he is right. "I am just saying to be careful. We have to not attract suspicion. We don't know what the neighbors are like, and we could get arrested and who knows what else."
<p>

Tim nods. "I think you know what else."
<p>

"Yes." He leans over and gives me a quick kiss on the cheek. I sigh, enjoying that. I enjoyed it too much, I must focus on translating.
<p>

I look straight up at him. "You got more papers to translate? I'll take them in a moment."
<p>

He hands me a thick stack of papers in one hand. I must have looked confused, because he says "Fast photographer."
<p>

I nod, finishing read and take the stack of papers.
<p>

Even though it was a whisper, Tim speaking surprises me. "Anything?"
<p>

I shake my head and keep reading. He walks away, perhaps to get more papers.
<p>

I get bored with pacing while reading and afraid enough that someone will see me through the window, so I sit on the piano bench and continue translating.
<p>

I see Tim coming in with more papers and manage not to punch him. Instead, I go back to translating and tell him "I am still not finished."
<p>

He tilts his head, still holding the stack of papers. "What's with the piano?"
<p>

I shrug. "I am not the one who put it by the stairwell." I glance at it again and huff in frustrated anger.
<p>

He shakes his head. "I mean, why are you always walking away from it, then toward, then back away, then back again, and now sitting near it?"
<p>

I sigh and look up at him, a little glad for the distraction. "I often pace. I do that when I am thinking. It's been a while since I read German. Some of the bureaucratic terms are new to me, despite speaking this most of my life."
<p>

He puts the stack beside me and says, "I'm not talking about the pacing, I'm talking about the piano." He walks away. Perhaps he is looking for more paperwork. I hear faint sounds of locks opening, an occasional muttered curse, the shuffling of papers and the click of the camera. I keep on translating.
<p>

I finish reading my stack, and still have no information on the three people. I am wondering if we are lead on a mad chase. Hell, for all I know, this could be a trap. I gather the papers and walk around the ground floor, looking for Timothee.
<p>

I see him walking toward me in the front room, holding a decent stack of papers. I take them and go back to the piano. Over my shoulder, I can see him standing there.
<p>

When I sit down, I look up at him. "Why are you following me?"
<p>

He shrugs. "No other papers. I could look up in their bedrooms . . ."
<p>

"We might need to," I say with a frown and go back to reading.
<p>

He starts combing with my hair while I read. I like it, but cannot respond to it. I have to find the information. We broke in around early afternoon. What if they decide to come back from their leisurely drive and find us here? I make a point to read faster.
<p>

He keeps on touching me, starting from the head, then drifting down my nape, and finishing at the hollow of my back. I like it that better, but I don't want to stay that way.
<p>

"Timothee, later," I mutter. I did find something: informers have told them that some Jews from Salonika were missed in the last round-up. Oh dear, they have several blocks where they are suspected to be hiding. That is something I will have to get the group to keep them from being taken away.
<p>

"You hate that piano," he murmurs like he is conversing with the Invisible Man. Or perhaps me.
<p>

"It's out of tune, but that is not important."
<p>

"But it is--I mean, to you." Tim kneels between my legs and looks at me.
<p>

I keep reading, not really looking at him. "Nothing I can do about it."
<p>

He tilts his head and gives me a lopsided smirk. I glance at him and go back to reading. What does he have in his head? He then leans close to my ears and whispers "This is a great place to fuck without getting caught."
<p>

I glance him and see him smirk wider. I look back at the paper and say "So masturbate."
<p>

In my head, however, everything becomes sharper. I feel edgier, the hallway seems so dark and smells more strongly of old wood and my pants are tighter. It has been a long, long while before we were together, but I have to keep on translating. Three people's lives are at stake.
<p>

On the other hand, something about that idea appeals to me, this mix of spite and lust. I have to remind myself to keep reading, before we lose Bartek, Christine and Tatiana.
<p>

I feel stupid. This is the same person who staged mock suicides while Marie sang "Gloomy Sunday?" Who cheerfully read some gruesome news stories from the yellow press while the band played? I am doing something important, but I want to pull a nice little prank while I do it.
<p>

I look up at him and smirk. "In the shadows, now." He is quick to obey. I'm impressed.
<p>

I unzip his pants quick and already find him semi-hard. I can fix that, and find out information. Johann isn't the only juggler in this troupe.
<p>

I develop a nice rhythm of sucking and reading, licking and reading, sometimes stroking him with my free hand while reading. Tim, for his part, bites his sleeve to keep quiet. Such a brave boy, hardening in my mouth. He is warm and slippery every time I suck.
<p>

He squeaks behind his sleeve, and I taste the saltiness of semen. I don't swallow it as usual, but mix it slightly in my mouth. I spit it out on the nice, cream-colored rug just behind the piano.
<p>

Almost as a reward I finally find names: Stefan Bartek and Christine Richaud. I wipe my mouth and read more, finding that they are in a prison in the suburbs, after not telling the Gestapo anything. Oh god, execution will be in a few days.
<p>

We have to get people moving, get Bartek and Christine out of there before they are killed. Maybe if we find them, they can tell us what happened to Tatiana.
<p>

At dawn, Nataniah drives us into the neighborhood mentioned in the papers. She is able to tell us something about the refugees. Some of them have family in France. Some of them escaped from Salonika, waiting for some papers or willing transport to Lisbon and Madrid.
<p>

All around us was gray sky that just turns from dark to light, dirty snow, and muddy, narrow streets. Jules, Vatos, Johann and I shiver in old black suits, like undertakers. Nataniah is swaddled in scarves and coats, partially to keep warm and to keep from being seen. A lock of golden brown hair falls down her face as she watches us get off the cart. We used it before, with the same two coffins. Perhaps this will be the last time we use them. Otherwise, it will become too obvious.
<p>

We each take a block and arrange to meet in the back alley with whomever we can get out. We may not have enough room or they may be crippled and unable to walk. In the back of my mind, I wonder if we will get them out before the round-up comes.
<p>

I knock on the first door. When it is not opened immediately, I look behind me, searching for uniformed men.
<p>

A small, old woman with a cane finally opens the door. I start talking in French, telling her that I got information there will be a round-up and that she has to get out.
<p>

She blinks and tilts her head. She shakes her head and is about to close the door.
<p>

I am angry at myself. I should have figured that she might not be as strong in French as I thought. What language would she speak? I start speaking all the ancient Greek I remember, yelling loud enough perhaps for the neighborhood to hear.
<p>

A man taller than the older woman (taller than me too) with bushy dark hair comes to the door. "Sir," he says in halting French, "what are you doing speaking old Greek?"
<p>

I take a deep breath and tell about the round-up again in French. He sighs. "My grandmother doesn't speak either of those languages very well. I will have to translate for her." He murmurs to her in a language I am not sure is Greek, Hebrew or Spanish. The old woman looks horrified, and then sad, and answers back.
<p>

The grandson nods. "She says I must go. She cannot move much and will only slow everyone down. She is dying anyway." He says some more words and looks at me with bigger brown eyes than I thought. "I cannot leave her. I don't know what to do."
<p>

I remember Herr Professor Acker's letter and the slipped tales of burning barns and burning corpses. "I will find a way to get her out, sir."
<p>

"You can call me David. I'll go to the other neighbors."
<p>

"My friends are doing that."
<p>

"They might need a translator. Some of the older people aren't very strong in French."
<p>

I nod. "Hurry, I don't know when they will be coming." He murmurs a few more words and runs.
<p>

I run to the cart and grab the coffin. She looks at it for a while, wondering what I am doing. I point outside. She nods and gets in the coffin slowly. I hear her chuckle low and say a few words, but I am not quite sure what is she is saying. Perhaps she is trying to joke about it. I put the lid on, and wonder who should I ask for help.
<p>

Then, in the distance, I hear the rumbling of jeeps. At that moment, Vatos, David and Jules run into the front room.
<p>

"Johann was able to get some people out and running, so was that young man, but we couldn't warn all of them. Some apartments are empty. Either they left or so afraid we were Gestapo," Vatos says.
<p>

"Some of them ran in other directions," Jules adds.
<p>

"Damn it. Gentlemen, I'll need your help carrying this coffin."
<p>

"Where's the girl?"
<p>

"I think just down the block."
<p>

Jules and David grab at the ends and lift. Jules and David are the same height, so they keep the coffin level. "We can handle it," Jules says. With that, they move the coffin with another living person out of the house.
<p>

I look out the window and see Johann look in the distance. He motions to nowhere in particular, and the people start running.
<p>

Vatos turns to me and mutters, "They're going to go after the people hiding. The poor devils won't last long. We've got to distract them."
<p>

"Do you have any idea how many are coming to round up the neighborhood, Hernandez?"
<p>

"I much rather fight them than not." With that, he goes behind the corner and loads his pistol. I follow suit, not wanting him to hold him off alone. I crouch behind an old and big red chair. Fine enough cover for me.
<p>

I realize at that moment I could die in the firefight. There is much I could have done. Out of all the ways to die, perhaps fighting is not the worst. Not what I prefer, but not the worst.
<p>

Two men in gray great coats and rifles slam open the door and start yelling for everyone to come out. I pop out from behind the chair and fire. He falls down, but I am not sure if he is dead or wounded. Nevertheless, his companion charges toward me. Vatos comes from the corner and fires at the other Gestapo agent. He does come down, but yells outside for the others.
<p>

Two more agents armed with rifles run into the sitting room, make fast for the red chair. I push the chair for distraction. The chair goes down with a thud, making them jump back. It's only a moment, though, since they run around the chair as best as they can. I see Vatos run out the back door, while I run up the stairs. I catch a glance of Jules running into the sitting room with a pistol in his hand.
<p>

I climb out the hallway window and onto a gutter. Somehow, despite the slippery surface, I don't break anything when I land. I land hard though, making my feet and muscles ache.
<p>

Coming straight toward me are more agents. I lunge behind a dumpster and start ducking behind and shooting.
<p>

I peek out and they are still shooting. I feel a sharp and hot pain in my left arm and duck back. I look down and I am bleeding all over my left arm.
<p>

I've been shot, and Johann is trying to get everyone else out. Fuck, I'll have to stanch the wound myself.
<p>

I tear a piece of cloth from my shirt tail, already fuming over fabric shortages. I switch the pistol to my left hand and hold the cloth down with my right. Perhaps shooting with an injured arm is not smart, but I peek out and shoot again.
<p>

I glance again and see no more men coming at me. I check the chamber, and see no more bullets. Shit. I wonder if they will be coming from behind. So, I run forward, hoping to find Johann or at least a safe place to catch my breath. I swipe a rifle from an unconscious Gestapo agent and run on.
<p>

I find an open back door and hope the apartment is empty. I see a Gestapo agent pulling a heavy set young woman out of a pantry. Well, the apartment is not empty. He sees me, but before he can reach for his pistol, I shoot at him with my rifle. He crumples to the floor like paper and the woman stares at me with big, scared brown eyes.
<p>

"I don't know if you understand me," I tell her in French, "but I've got to get you out of here."
<p>

"I understand enough. Get me out of here," she says in halting French.
<p>

I see the small piece of cloth is red with my blood. "You got a dishrag or something?" She throws me an old gray dishrag and I use it as a tourniquet. I wince and wonder if I am pushing the bullet down. God knows the wound in my leg still reminds me of how much getting shot hurts like hell.
<p>

"Follow me," I tell her. We take off out of the apartment and into the alley. If I let myself think, I would horrified that I killed someone. I know enough veterans of the Great War and their pacifist children to know that is expected.
<p>

I cannot let myself think, though. I still hear screams and bullets. People beg to get their clothing, people beg for mercy and people scream in pain. I wonder if Jules and Johann got people out. I wonder if David is safe. I hear someone yell in German that the Spaniard is down. Oh God, not Vatos. I have no time to mourn, either.
<p>

We hide behind a water barrel in another alley. My legs shake from the running, while my arm throbs in pain again. I check the rifle again, seeing there is some ammunition. I fill the pistol chamber with bullets in a small package at my belt loop.
<p>

"You need a doctor," the woman says.
<p>

After I fill the chamber, I tell her "Not before I get you out of here." I realize I might make too much noise. I look up at the sky, wondering what next. I see the full light of morning turning the sky light gray.
<p>

I take off my muddy and worn boots and hand them to the woman. She looks at me horrified and confused. "What are you doing?"
<p>

"They can't hear me, I learned it from a newspaper reporter. Besides, I don't like shoes very much." Her shoes were so thin, that I didn't worry about her making a noise.
<p>

I wait for a moment and check that no one is coming down the street. I get a second wind and lead the woman out. My feet are cold and get a shard of broken glass in my foot. However, I managed to avoid slipping on the putrefying trash, so I consider it a success.
<p>

I fall to the floor when I get to the safehouse. I see Johann looking down at me. His head is tilted and his hands are folded.
<p>

"Jules was worried you were hurt. How do you feeling?"
<p>

I look up at him and squint. "How do I look?"
<p>

Johann unwraps the dishrag and takes off my shirt. I sit with my undershirt, wincing as Johann takes the bullet out. He uses ointment and gauze while I shut my eyes. He chuckles, "You are less sensitive than the last time you got shot." I wince not from the pain, but from the memory of Tim. He is somewhere else in Paris, making false passports. I will see him again, I tell myself. With that, Johann cleans the cut on my foot.
<p>

The rest of the day I rest, then meet with Jules and Avila, telling of the blueprint of the prison Bartek and Christine are being held. Tatiana is in the room, laundering and repairing my shirt the best she can. We tell of what to do if they break under torture (the Gestapo will do just about anything to get information). We talk about Vatos, who is dead. Jules tells me he was just wounded, but before Johann could get to him, more agents ran to him. He used his last bullet on himself so he wouldn't talk.
<p>

I keep talking, since it pushes out the look on the man's face after I shot him out of my mind's eye.
<p>

After I tell the experienced ones about the transfer, we devise a plan. In a few days, Bartek and Christine are being transferred to Fresnes after their death sentence is read. Right now, they are held at Avenue Foch, and only they know what the Gestapo is doing to them.
<p>

That evening, Louise pulls me to an alleyway a few blocks from Avenue Foch. "They will let me let me say goodbye to Stefan."
<p>

I blink, looking confused at Louise. "What are you talking about?"
<p>

She taps her sharply angled nose (a habit she picked up from Timothee) and leans close to me. "Want to see how I found out what time they are leaving?" With that, she relaxes her face. She cups her hands and places them over her face.
<p>

If I didn’t know how good an actress she was, I would think she was sobbing. "Oh, sir, he was just trying to save for our wedding. He told me he was delivering papers and busking. I . . . I didn’t know he was in the black market. Please, please, sir. Just let me say good-bye to him. Let me say good-bye just one last time." She gulps and catches as if she was really sad.
<p>

Then she lifts her head up, face unstreaked by tears, and shrugs. It was then I noticed that her hands are pruned and red, like you expect from hours of laundry.
<p>

"That convinced them to tell you where to wait for him?"
<p>

"No, it was tearfully offering the officers brandy and silk stockings. Marie hated giving them up, but it worked."
<p>

"And what did they tell you?"
<p>

"There is a hill a few miles from Fresnes, near a factory. They promised to keep the back door slit open, so he can see me wave good-bye with my handkerchief"
<p>

I nod. "Thank you. I’ll tell the others."
<p>

"Oh, wait, Daniel, how is Grissette? Is Johann taking good care of it?"
<p>

"Johann is taking the best care he can under the circumstances."
<p>

"I wish I could visit him, but some of the household came down," then she whispers, "with lice."
<p>

"Oh, you do not have much soap."
<p>

"If you can buy some, will you?"
<p>

"I’ll see what I can do." People expect me to get more explosives, now it is soap.
<p>

She nods and I walk away. I turn with a smirk and say "We could always offer Grissette as collateral the next time."
<p>

Louise’s eyes widen in horror and her jaw drops. "You do that and . . ."
<p>

I raise my hands as if to deflect punches. "Oh no, no, I was joking." I then walk away, trying to think of how to get bullets for the few guns we have.
<p>

After several meetings just before curfew, we come up with a plan. A few minutes before a ball rings to signal the end of the working day, Louise will go up on the hill. We will wait for her to wave her hankie, and then we move.
<p>

We get the people who will be going sorted. Johann will stay back and treat the wounded. Jules and Avila will rush the trucks with the functioning guns we still have. I have a few sticks of dynamite and home made bombs.
<p>

I wonder of our fate if Johann cannot treat our wounds. Avila may follow Vatos' example, unafraid of death. Jules has quietly stated that he will not commit suicide, but will rather die than talk. I fear I will not have the courage to commit suicide nor the fortitude to withstand torture. Such thoughts I am having. I never thought of killing myself; I preferred to laugh at death. Death is here, waiting, and does not like to be mocked. I know this.
<p>

As we walk to the factory, with Louise leading the way, I would hear noises. I hear the crunch of the twigs and leaves. I look behind me. Perhaps it is just one of the men.
<p>

It occurs to me that dead winter leaves crunch as each person steps on them. The crunching sound gets softer as each person steps over the same spot. I hear my feet, then Avila, then Jules and then Johann. Then I hear a fifth soft crunch.
<p>

I look quietly behind me. Nothing.
<p>

A conversation distracts me. "You changed your last name," Avila says in a low voice.
<p>

"It meant 'retard,'" Johann replies. He doesn't speak for a while and then adds, "Perhaps it was too true for me."
<p>

Louise waves her handkerchief and we take to the hills and warrens, natural hiding places. I look in her direction. Jules and I argued on whether to use a gun butt or dynamite to break open the windows. No matter, I can at least make the trucks stops.
<p>

I light a firecracker and throw it toward the middle of the road. I duck back down and hear the trucks screech to a halt. I recognize the bang of Jules' rifle. The truck stops; the driver is dead. I hear someone screaming in German, calling for reinforcements. We better do this fast.
<p>

The bastard pulls out a machine gun, but it doesn't matter. As fast as I can, I lob dynamite at the windows. Matches and explosives are precious, so I have to aim well. Somehow, the prison trucks keep the prisoners safe from the explosions, at least until they get out. Avila and Jules do their best with the arms they have. Workers leaving for the day see the fight and start running away from the main road. From this point, anything can go wrong.
<p>

That's when I see a young girl running. She grabs a parked bicycle by the gate. She then ducks and weaves through the firefight, holding a bicycle for a shield.
<p>

Now I see the girl come closer, climbing into the first truck's broken windows. She fishes out the keys, getting some scrapes on her legs, and runs to us. Now I see her clearly: it's Naomi, Jules' sister.
<p>

The second driver notices this too and races to grab Naomi. Jules shoots him, two in the chest.
<p>

Naomi pulls away and runs to us. "The drivers called for back-up ten minutes ago," Avila says. "It's a twenty minute drive from the base to here. We have to get the prisoners moving."
<p>

Jules turns to Naomi and reacts as any brother would. "What are you doing here? You could have been killed," he yells.
<p>

"I was bored, I didn't want to do laundry all day," Naomi says, a familiar teenage lament.
<p>

"Well, never mind," I snarl. "Get the keys to the second truck, we got prisoners to free."
<p>

"What about you," Jules says.
<p>

"I'm watching for reinforcements, just go. I can hold them off from here." I am running out of bombs and dynamite, but he doesn't need to know that yet.
<p>

I didn't look behind me while watching for more trucks, but I could hear it. I hear Naomi, and perhaps Johann, grabbing keys and unlocking doors. I see two jeeps and do my level best to knock them out. One stops, though it stays intact. The other has its tires on fire.
<p>

Gunfire starts again. A bullet grazes my cheek, but I am too focused o using whatever explosives I have left to staunch the wound. At the very least, the freed prisoners are happy, giving a hardy shout then running away. I see Bartek by my side soon after.
<p>

"I have to do something," Bartek says. "Christine got the guard's shotgun and is joining the firefight.
<p>

"I don't have much though, one or two sticks of dynamite and a bomb that may work . . ."
<p>

I see a jeep racing down. Bartek turns to me and says, "For a moment there, I thought the escape would be too easy."
<p>

I duck to light the dynamite and reply, "So did I."
<p>

More jeeps keep coming, and they are shouting out their windows.
<p>

I hear a yelp and look quickly. Naomi looks pained and falls to the ground, twisting to the right. Johann runs to her side. "She's been hit," he says.
<p>

Johann grabs a bandage from his kit and pulls Naomi to the side of the jeep. Jules looks over and yells, "I didn’t want that to happen to you."
<p>

Naomi looks right back and snaps, "I knew what I was getting into!"
<p>

Avila ducks to reload and says "Your French is getting better."
<p>

Naomi sucks in breath and then replies, "Thank you, Monsieur Avila."
<p>

"Call me Juan," he says after looking out through space between jeeps.
<p>

Naomi shakes her head. "It’s easier for me to call you Avila." He shrugs and starts shooting again.
<p>

Bartek nudges me. "Last stick of dynamite," he says.
<p>

I look over at the people here. "I’m pretty useless without explosives, guys."
<p>

Jules nods. "And we don’t have any arms for you two."
<p>

"Then Stefan and I have to get out."
<p>

Jules nods. No reinforcements are coming in yet. I sprint away to the fields. I glance and see Bartek running in the opposite direction.
<p>

Oh Lord, what an absurd game, looking for spaces to hide in open fields and edges of forest. I keep searching for lower ground. So then, I am a rabbit looking for a warren. Perhaps I will live with Grissette. I sprint from depression to depression, keeping the safe house location in mind. This is much better than the tunnels and catacombs. I am in more danger of being spotted, but there are openings. I can find a way out.
<p>

I am closer to the town, and closer to the safe house. However, it is getting late and curfew comes soon. I think that I look sweaty, battered and suspicious. I come to the street and hide behind a corner where I see a woman clutching a bundle. Why? No time to ask. There are 'terrorists wanted' posters on the buildings and I hope to God I am not on them.
<p>

I see some of the residents running fast; they don't want to be caught either. I bend down behind a tree and take off my shoes. The ground is hard, but not jagged nor freezing. This is rare so late in January. From there, I walk slowly then sprint. Every time I hear something that is not crickets or the cry of foxes, I find some place to hide. It doesn't matter if it is a basement, behind a house or under a bush. I manage to make it safely.
<p>

I didn't catch up with Johann until a week later. He sits beside me on the floor and sighs. "Avila, he got shot badly. He is resting, and I treated the wounds, but I could only do so much with what I still have. Bartek hasn't left his side when he is not delivering sheets."
<p>

He lowers his head. "There is something else. A woman prisoner told Bartek this, and he told me. Christine wouldn't talk. So the interrogators stripped her, dosed her in freezing water and threw her back in her cell. Thankfully, another prisoner smuggled dry clothing and a thin blanket, because she would have frozen to death otherwise."
<p>

I nod. "The others are well?"
<p>

Johann nods, and adds, "Though the poor devils who escaped may have been recaptured."
<p>

"Did any of them know where Tatiana is?"
<p>

"I never asked, and Bartek and Christine say they never saw her, and they have no idea where she is."
<p>


I should have seen the signs it was going to be a bad day. The promised shipment of turnips and potatoes never arrived at the market, making the ration coupons Helene and Marie gathered useless. They managed to get soap, but it is already a chore to hide the downed airmen. This will make feeding them harder. Christine may secure some black market crops, maybe smuggle food from her family. No one is making promises, though.
<p>

I have to pick up more explosives that afternoon. Maybe I needed some cheering up when Tim taps me on the shoulder. "My hand, you know, cramped. Uh, get drums with you?" Even among ourselves, we slip into code.
<p>

For a moment, I considered telling him to stay. That is too dangerous for him, after that prison break. He takes my hand and says "I have extra money from, um, services. You can get more . . . things." He looks at me straight, like he did sorting through the horrible scenarios for me.
<p>

"Sure," I say, "get your coat, the one without the lice."
<p>

For all my fear and worry, I feel good walking with Tim. He lopes just behind me, sometimes showing a shy little smile. You would think we were going to dinner with friends and not going to an explosives lab for more supplies. I was almost hopeful.
<p>

I turn a corner and see trucks and Milice charging into the apartment. Well, shit, there goes my good mood.
<p>

I turn to him and say, "Let's go." We turn the other way when we hear someone screaming to get us. That was when we started to run.
<p>

I look behind me and see a black car charging me. Shit, I bet it is one of the Milice, that scary fucking militia for the regime, driving. I grab Tim close to me and try to keep ahead of everyone.
<p>

A block down, and a miracle happened. We must have lost them. I was about to
tell Tim to get in an alley so we can figure out what to do next. I see that goddamned black car again.
<p>

I had enough time to shout "Tim!" He looks at me with the wide eyes of a startled sleep walker. The black car then drives beside him and he starts to run. Somebody, with large arms in a coat, reaches and grabs him, and he tries to pull away. I cannot think, I just start running toward him. He may be stronger than he looks, but he looks like he needs help.
<p>

He beats the assailant with his fists and struggles out of his grip. I grab on his wrists and try to pull him away. That is when another person grabs Tim by the shoulder and pulls him in. I try to grab him, but the door slams shut and the car speeds away.
<p>

They are too fast to run after, and I am too tired from running from the explosives lab. I couldn't get a license plate either. Who would I report them to, anyway? My God, if they were Milice, why didn't they grab me? They must know I am the center of all this, but they grabbed Tim. Perhaps they kidnapped him to get to me. Oh God, oh God, can he really stand up to torture? Even Christine is more cautious after her stint in prison.
<p>

He is gone, someone took him, I don't know why and I am afraid. For now, I
must duck into an alley and think of something. I do not want to cap this rotten day with me getting arrested.
<p>


<i>Tim sits stiff in the car between two men.
<p>

The more slender man in the dark suit speaks first. "Do you speak English, Monsieur Burton?"
<p>

He squints at him. "Fuck off."
<p>

The larger man shrugs. "I guess he does."</i>
<p>


<i>Dead leaves and dirt are stuck on Rabbi Asimov's great coat. He crotches down and sweeps off what he could. He made sure Nehemiah and Shifra are ahead of him, moving toward the meeting place.
<p>

It is times like these that he wished he had the Hasidim's foolish optimism. No matter. There are no guarantees that he will make it on time, or even make it.
<p>

Which is why, to Nehemiah's great shock and dismay, he time him to leave with Shifra if they do not see him.
<p>

He remembers what he told Nehemiah in the cellar. "Land safely in England no matter what happens to me. You never really talked much about your birthplace."
<p>

Nehemiah whispered, "I left for knowledge."
<p>

"You and Shifra will be safer there."
<p>

"I am not leaving my teacher and master behind. I am not leaving a fellow Jew behind," Nehemiah said with a stiff lip and wide eyes.
<p>

Rabbi Asimov looked him straight into his eyes and placed his hand on Nehemiah's shoulder. "Do not let your morals get in the way of doing what is right. I will catch up, I am only making sure you and my wife survive if I do not. If I do not, well, I have done enough in my life."
<p>

The woods are dark and cold, just as it always is in Lithuania. Rabbi Asimov stays to the woods, just moving when he thinks it is safe. He is no fighter, so he runs. He wonders about the quiet. Perhaps the partisans are keeping the Nazis busy. Then again, it may not last long. There are more Nazis than partisans. Nevertheless, he keeps his steady walk.
<p>

On his next sprint, he stands up just a little. Soon after, he feels a small and sharp pain in his head. His last sight is looking down and seeing blood on his great coat.
<p>

After he falls to the ground, instantly dead, a farmer comes out.
<p>

"Not a deer, love, a Jew." The farmer turns to hear faint yelling. "Well, he could have been out to steal a child."
<p>


Hours after he spoke to Rabbi Asimov, Nehemiah and Shifra made it to the meeting place. Nehemiah puts a shawl around Shifra. She nods quietly and keeps looking out. It is dark and cold in the forest and it smells like frost, dead leaves, wet ground and sweat. Through maneuvering, bribes and Betar members hiding in plain sight, Nehemiah got passports to England. He could anyway; he was born in Liverpool. The decision to leave for Vilna was his own: he had heard it called the Jerusalem of Eastern Europe, perhaps even all of Europe. He would have been safer, but he wanted to be among those deep in the pool of the wisdom of ancestors. He was content to circle around Rabbi Asimov, tending to small tasks. Perhaps he will die for his ambition, but he will not let that happen.
<p>

Just then, he hears the clanking and clinking like glasses knocking against other glasses. He sees a cart full of preserve jars and dingy driver with a bottle by his side. Nehemiah takes one last look behind him, grabs Shifra and sprints toward the cart.
<p>

It is hard to keep still, squatting among the many jars, wondering if one of them was going to crash on them. Many times, Nehemiah wonders where Rabbi Asimov is. A dead lion will at least be mourned, Nehemiah thinks. Nehemiah keeps his thoughts quiet.
<p>

Soon, they will be in Greece. Shifra and Nehemiah will get a boat to Lisbon, then a boat to Liverpool. Much can happen and they could be turned away at any point. He only hopes they stay living dogs and not become dead lions with no mourners.<p>

</i>

Curfew is coming, but for some reason, I haven't left the alley since the afternoon. I duck every time someone is taking out garbage or sneaking out. I revise the day in so many ways and trying to see where was the moment I doomed Timothee. Was it not picking up explosives yesterday? Was it saying 'yes'? Was it not asking for Nataniah's cart?
<p>

I stayed in Paris because of him. My friends were there, but he was my strongest tie here. Now I am too deep to give up and there are too many people for me to help just to leave. I gave up my chance to escape so others can escape. I did also so I'd never feel so empty as I did after I broke up the troupe. I never told him that he made me feel better even in the worst of it. Am I in love? He said he loved me. What if he didn't? The car could be a clever ruse, the lover as the traitor. Oh God, no.
<p>

What next, me dying by my hand in this alley? No, fuck no. I've got to get to some place safe. For one thing, it smells like rotting meat. It is a good thing my sense of smell isn't as keen as my hearing, because I'd run from the smell. What sort of animal would smell so bad?
<p>

When I was a boy, one of our neighbors collected stuffed and preserved animals. I would play with the neighbor's children, but in truth, I just wanted to stare at the glassy eyed deer and the preserved cow fetus he had. That same curiosity is pulling me down the alley. I lope like a wounded werewolf behind garbage cans, keeping an eye out for intruders.
<p>

It occurs to me that we still have not found Tatiana. I hope she is well and safe. Hell, I hope she isn't a traitor. No one really knew where she was all this time.
<p>

The stench almost knocks me back. I am in the right place. I stand up, wondering what I will see. There is a tuff of blonde fur. Perhaps this is a dog. No, that tuff is too long for the dogs around here. I touch it. Dirty, but somewhat soft, and definitely a white-blonde. This is human hair.
<p>

I push a can back and see the whole body. Her hair is caked with blood and dirt and her face is frozen in shock. There is a thick silver string tossed beside her, caked with something brown. I realize that this is piano wire. She still has on a thin coat and a skirt sewn many times. She was strangled with piano wire; a thin red line is on her neck, and her chest and arms are covered in blood. The skirt has very good stitching like Tatiana used to do.
<p>

I take another good look at her face and almost fall over. I have found Tatiana.
<p>


<i>This is a still life of an argument in an alley. Two men in black coats and one blonde woman in a thin coat argue. She still has her Russian accent yelling at the men.
<p>

"I'm not telling you where they are! You told me to inform on Communists and radicals and I did! Danny and Richard are not Communists, so I won't tell you where they went!"
<p>

"They are Jews. That is enough." Tatiana tried to scream, but one of the men covered her mouth too fast. The last thing she saw was another man pulling piano wire taut and leaning against Tatiana.</i> 
<p>


I remember that, nearby, there was a university library that is open late. Perhaps the head librarian or some official is a collaborator, but is relatively untouched by surprise raids. Most of the shelves are empty however, because of censorship.
<p>

I walk in and see Miriam with some books. I glance at her then look at a shelf, not wanting to attract suspicion. We go into a section.
<p>

I whisper, "The dressmaker is down and she was sewing for the Munich Symphony."
<p>

Miriam squints at me. "How do you know," she whispers.
<p>

I lower my head. "The poet once told me that a siren who doesn't sing well gets piano wire." Sirens are informers. Plus, I remember the thick shiny string beside her cadaver.
<p>

Miriam takes this with furrowed brows and stares down at the floor. "I didn't know. How long was she doing this?"
<p>

"I don't know. Also, the set designer . . .fuck, I haven't thought of any clever phrases for this . . .some men in a black car, they took him."
<p>

Miriam's jaw drops at this. "You think . . .you think this is a card trick of some sort?" For someone who came late to the group, she is picking up the code fast. Sometimes we hear of informers getting taken away to throw people off or because they failed in some way. We call them 'card tricks.'
<p>

"I don't know that either." If I keep talking, I'll start talking about how I should have brought my gun with me, then this wouldn't have happened. Then again, it was starting to misfire, and it will take a while to scrap the money to get a new gun or a gunsmith. I decided to use the money to get explosives instead. How fucking stupid is that in retrospect?
<p>

We move to another stack, hoping no one overheard us. "It must hurt," she whispers.
<p>

"Does it matter if it does?"
<p>

"All you can do is keep going." Miriam pauses to shake her head. "I am no good at advising the love lives of others."
<p>

I nod. Miriam wipes her eyes and continues talking. "So, what now?"
<p>

I thought about it. Even with Tatiana dead, she let slip enough to arrest us all. The safe houses the other women run are in danger, the people who handle the weapons are in danger and even a bedridden Avila with Bartek waiting by his side is in danger. I stuff my hands in my pockets and try to think of something.
<p>

"We all have to get somewhere and decide where to go," she murmurs.
<p>

"I don't know. That could be closed too." That's a euphemism for 'compromised.'
<p>

"There has to be a way to get this out as soon as possible."
<p>

That is when I thought of something. I whisper, "Tell them what I told you. Tell to give me song titles for where they are going." Tell them to get the fuck out of Paris, I think, but the library demands quiet.
<p>

I rub my face. I cannot believe I am breaking up the group the second time, but this time, it's not to save my skin. It's to protect those who we've helped and the others we will help.
<p>

Miriam nods. She then smiles a little and says, "Have you noticed? We're not arguing?"
<p>

"What's there to argue about?"
<p>

She nods and walks away.
<p>


<i>"Ah, I see that you changed your surname on your passport. Timothee Guillaume Lavigne. Lavigne was your mother's maiden name. You made your first and middle name more French, too."
<p>

"So? My mother was French. That was what she would have named me, but even before I was born, my father demanded I be what he wants. I suppose some people would prefer 'Timothy William,' but not me."
<p>

"You do not want to be what he wants."
<p>

"I had no talent for banking, and to me, money was only something to trade paint and brushes for. I knew I was different from him even when I was twelve. When Mama. . ."
<p>

Tim falters at this point, closing his eyes and leaning into his hard chair. He sighs and says, "I don't know why you people grabbed me during fucking firefight, and you know, people need me, and um, I don't think I can help you sitting here and we need some fucking supplies too, your people, where the--"
<p>

"So that is why you left for Paris to live with your grandmother at age twelve."
<p>

"So you still are at it. Well, I could go to a drafty public school and get raped by future prime ministers and judges or I can be in some place with art and music and some resemblance of a fucking civilization."
<p>

"Ah, strong words. I won't take offense, sir. You never spoke to him after?"
<p>

"He may have sent letters, and I may have answered, one or two. I think I threw away most of them."
<p>

"You never really knew anything about your father? His politics and his affiliations?"
<p>

"What the hell are you talking about?"</i>
<p>



Louise delivers me the titles in a safe house on the edges of city. She is wearing a white coat with the fur rubbed down and the edges all dingy. She carries Grissette in some sort of basket. His small head is poking out and he is chewing on a blade of grass. Johann and Helene give me the "Jonas Salk Rag." Christine and Naomi give me "La Dijonesse." Marie and Miriam give me "I'm Staying Home, Darling." Jules gave an excerpt from "Peter and the Wolf." Bartek gives me "St. James Infirmary" but Avila gives me "The Battle March of the Last Communitarian." Damn, they are arguing.
<p>

"I suppose that is it," I murmur. Louise nods and pets Grissette's head. Despite all else that happened, the rabbit looks well enough, not too scrawny and not showing any signs of disease. Judging by the thawing grass Louise has in her pocket, she is feeding Grissette the best she can under the circumstances.
<p>

"I notice you haven't given me a song."
<p>

She nods. "I want to go with you, Daniel."
<p>

I blink and tilt my head at Louise. "Why? You know that it is dangerous."
<p>

"It was dangerous even when I was in the safe houses. It was dangerous for me to write my play."
<p>

"That doesn't really answer the question."
<p>

She bends her head and pets Grissette again. "You are the closest thing to Timothee I have."
<p>

I nod. "I don't know where he is, and I am not sure I will ever find him."
<p>

"You will, I know you will."
<p>

How can she be so sure? She nods with certainty of someone who believes that evil and cruelty are only temporary. It is not just being Catholic; I know faithful and pessimistic Catholics. This is beyond religion, or maybe at the root of it. She has the certainty of someone who knows how the story will end, even if she won't be there. I am just not like that.
<p>

"If I say no, where will you go?"
<p>

She smiles softly, shrugs and says, "I don't know. I trust God to keep me safe."
<p>

I don't put my trust in invisible beings. "You can come with me."
<p>

She bends her head and says, "Thank you." She pets Grissette and I think to myself that I may not be at the end of the story.
<p>

Before we make our way to a small town north of Paris, I ask Marie to radio London and tell them we have broken up, but still alive. When I get some idea what I am doing, I will contact them again. Right now, I can only keep Louise and me safe.
<p>

Etienne, the owner of the house, is a son of a farmer. While he was an engineer, he kept three chickens and two goats. The animals never bothered anyone, and they kept a good supply of chicken, eggs, and goat milk. Since he fed most of the town, no one bothered him. This is also a perfect cover for any strange noises that the neighbors hear. Considering how often he argues with authorities over rationing, he is willing to hide resistants. This is what I am told, but I still worry.
<p>

Louise and I are put in the attic with one table. Etienne holds some thick blankets for us.
<p>

"Why is this so empty," Louise whispers.
<p>

Etienne leans over and whispers, "I sold most of the old furniture to pay off expenses that came up during the occupation." He nods, drops the blankets and walks away, not really telling us just what or whom he was paying off.
<p>

I am used to sleeping on the floor, so I just lie down and put a blanket over me. Louise wraps her blanket around her and lays her head over her arms to get comfortable. It is quiet now, like the moments in penny dreadfuls before some monstrosity crashes in. No monsters here, though I am still scared.
<p>

"Daniel," Louise whispers.
<p>

I sigh, realizing I am not going to get any sleep. "Yeah?"
<p>

"You look like you need a cuddle."
<p>

"I'm fine, I sleep better alone," I lie.
<p>

"You didn't before. Some nights I would sleep beside Tim and you."
<p>

"Yes, that's true." I had nothing else to say. Before the war, I would stay over their apartment when I wasn't working on some production or another. While she slept, Tim and I would be very quiet. Sometimes we would just hold each other; sometimes we would rub against each other, barely covered by our shirts. We didn't worry about stains. In those days, we had soap, so we could do regular laundry.
<p>

"When you would be asleep, he would pet me."
<p>

"After he would pet me?"
<p>

She shrugs. "Sometimes." He had more stamina than I thought. She never mentioned intercourse; maybe she really was saving it for marriage.
<p>

She sighs. "He never made me do anything I didn't want to, unlike others." She is still waiting. There are other ways for a girl to get some pleasure.
<p>

"How come I never heard anything?"
<p>

"I would stuff my knuckles into my mouth. Sometimes it was hard when he would stroke just so. . ." She shudders and turns on her side. I think of what if I asked if I could neck with her, but somehow, the idea doesn't appeal to me.
<p>

"Daniel? One more thing?"
<p>

"Yes?"
<p>

"You've been with women, right?"
<p>

"Well, yes."
<p>

"Timothee has been with me."
<p>

"Yes?"
<p>

"So, why are you together, if you can get women? I know of men in prison and men in boarding schools, but you two aren't suffering like that."
<p>

She means no harm. The question, however, unsettles me. This is more than friendship and more than sexual relief that keeps me here. Dare I say love? I don't dare.
<p>

"Well, Louise, I guess we've both been through too much to just be friends."
<p>

She closes her eyes and nods. Maybe she is satisfied with the answer. Maybe she recognizes the evasion. No matter. She asks no more questions tonight.
<p>

I finally got to sleep, keeping to a corner of the attic. I am still wearing my boots, and am sure I will wake up at the next loud noise.
<p>

Now I am no longer in the attic, no longer anywhere. Wait, the fine china, the paintings of the Rhine.
<p>

My God, I am home.
<p>

Mama is there, sometimes in blue, sometimes in white. Her red hair is in a bun, and she looks so concerned.
<p>

"Daniel," she says, "where have you been?"
<p>

Mother, I've been in Paris. Hitler, the laws, remember? Me, being kicked out of school?
<p>

"But you were always a good student."
<p>

I was expelled because I am Jewish.
<p>

"Daniel, there is something you are not telling me."
<p>

I took to drinking. My grades weren't as good as they were. They couldn't kick me out before, there were worse students than me, but the laws gave them incentive.
<p>

I am blurring languages, sometimes speaking German, sometimes French, sometimes English. She is speaking to me, and sometimes the words blur.
<p>

"Why do you stay in Paris? You are in as much danger as you were in Berlin."
<p>

I am in love, Mama. I haven't said that after Herr Professor Acker.
<p>

"Daniel, what are you telling me?"
<p>

I never told you before.
<p>

"You must have been so alone."
<p>

I was. I am not now.
<p>

"Who is she?"
<p>

It is a man, Mama. His name is Timothee.
<p>

Sometimes she looks so wrinkled and tired, sometimes like she did as a young woman.
<p>

"Does he love you?"
<p>

He told me he did.
<p>

"Have you told him?"
<p>

No.
<p>

I rub my face. Mama, do you hate me?
<p>

Her face is sad, confused, maybe regretful.
<p>

"It is new to me. There is much you shut me out of. I never did with my parents."
<p>

There is a war going on, people are disappearing.
<p>

"I remember when you were a baby. Richard was born during leave. You were our peace-time baby."
<p>

Did you think that this would happen, civilians being herded and killed? Cut down like rejects in a toy factory?
<p>

"Not like this. I feel like this is my fault somehow."
<p>

I made my own mistakes.
<p>

"Daniel . . .tell me more."
<p>

Tim is missing, someone kidnapped him, and I cannot find him. I arranged for escape for me and the girl, but I am not sure where I am going or where I will be assigned next.
<p>

"You will get killed."
<p>

I know. I think of the fate of Bartek and Christine, Vatos and Alla, maybe the others now scattered over France. I even feel sorry for Tatiana, with the dark mark where the piano wire cut her throat. I just hope I will live long enough to see him again. When I find out what I am doing after tonight, I will search for him. I will find a way.
<p>

She reaches out for me, then everything fades.
<p>


Etienne, the owner wakes me. "Getaspo, they are coming. They got their informers here, but my informer is warning me to get out."
<p>

"But I thought the gendarmerie did . . ."
<p>

"They are cracking down hard. We must get you out, now."
<p>

I grab my bag and wipe my face. Perhaps some old rain water fell, because my cheeks are wet.
<p>

Etienne runs down the stairs, cranes his neck over the railing, and then runs back up into the attic. "They are coming out the main road, you can't get out this way!"
<p>

Louise glances at the large round window across from the door. All you can see is a sliver of moon and the dark sky. She points to the window and says, "We'll climb out here."
<p>

I look at Louise. "Do you really think we can do it?"
<p>

She tilts her head. "Have you got another idea, Daniel?"
<p>

I sigh. "Let's climb out the window then."
<p>

Etienne unlocks the blot and opens the window. It is now colder, with freezing wind blowing into the room. "I'll make up a story, just go!" With that, Etienne throws down whatever effects we brought with us. Louise grabs her basket with Grissette with a huff before he can throw it. Basket in one hand, Louise gets out first and I follow.
<p>

She makes steady time, grabbing the second story window ledge while she balances on the back door's frame. Grissette's basket dangles from her hand, but I am not sure how scared he is. After she lands on the ground, Grissette under her arm, I try to climb faster than she could. I jump down and grab my bag. We take off running just when we hear trucks and cars pull up.
<p>

Louise and I run across fields and into patches of forest. Truthfully, I do not know where we are going. I have no idea what safe houses are still safe or where to hide.
<p>

Just then, a truck barrels out of the road and into the forest. Just as I was about to run, I see a dark shape lean out of the truck window. I look closer; the truck is white, like the milk trucks. With petrol and milk rationing and exporting milk to Germany, there are fewer and fewer of these around. What is it doing here?
<p>

The dark shape then yells, "Hey, you! Hey Red and Girlie, you with Etienne?" Louise glares and folds her arms. I just notice that the words are in English. For lack of better options, I'll assume he is an ally.
<p>

I nod. The shape then opens the door and says "Get in, we got something for you to do." Taking one final look behind me, I sprint to the milk truck and jump in. Louise follows, albeit more cautiously. He directs to get behind boxes and starts driving.
<p>

Boxes are banging into us, but we stay still. Louise whispers prayers, but I have nothing to say. I don't know where I'm going. I don't know if I am coming back to Paris. I don't know where Tim is. I know only I miss him, and I'm cold.
<p>

<i>
"What happened to the others?"
<p>

"They're alright, they just broke up and went separate ways."
<p>

"Where's Danny? Is he alive?"
<p>

"He is alive, but he is driven to an assignment outside of Paris. That is all I can tell you, Mr. Burton."
<p>

"I told you not to call me that."
<p>

"I'm sorry--"
<p>

"<b>Nom de Jesu</b>, just call me Tim then."
<p>

"Well then, Tim, that is really all I can tell you."
<p>

"When will I see him again?"
<p>

"When his assignment is complete. When you tell us where we can find your father."
<p>

"You never told me why you need my father so badly. Did he do something wrong?"
<p>

"Yes. Yes, he did."</i>
