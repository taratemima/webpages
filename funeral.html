This is Not a Funeral March
<br>By Tara
<p>Bad revelations and good decisions for the group. (NC-17)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>NC-17 rated AU Danny/Tim. Mixed couples dancing, , swearing, coded
allusions to
<br>war and violence, bad revelations about the Holocaust, a second hand
description
<br>of violence, m/m displays of affection and dry humping in the facilities,
chase
<br>scene, rambling about religious/ethnic identity and threat to child.
Also, this
<br>is fiction. I had this idea, "Gee, wouldn't it be ha-ha funny if Tim
Burton and
<br>Danny Elfman were in occupied Paris and were dating each other?" Then
I
<br>remembered that this is WWII we are talking about. My muses think I'm
a sadistic
<br>little cookie. I adapted an incident as retold in The Avengers by Rich
Cohen for
<br>Naomi-Chaiya's back-story (she will be in Paris later). Jacob Gens,
the Chief of
<br>Police for the Vilna Ghetto, is a real person, but everyone else is
not, or at
<br>least are fictional representations of real people. Partially inspired
by "Why'd
<br>We Go (All This Way?)," "Dazzle," "Try to Believe," "Ich Bin Auslander,"
Sam's
<br>speech in The Two Towers, and a lot more music.
<p>I really danced for the first time tonight. We were staying in an abandoned
<br>servant's quarters somewhere in the premier arrondissement, while the
Irish
<br>industrialist Paul O'Neil and his Armenian wife Sirvart went out for
the night.
<p>I know how to dance. It is a skill I learned at mixers and sometimes
at
<br>late-night marathons people went to forget hunger and inflation. I
lead, the
<br>girl followed, and I wished I could just sit down and listen to the
band.
<p>So, after putting Louis to bed, Richard and Marie turn on the radio
to BBC, for
<br>a program with banned music in French and German, I sit down with Tim.
He
<br>bounces his knee up and down to the music, giving small smiles when
he
<br>recognized the words. I just close my eyes, smiling while listening
to the
<br>interplay of words, instruments, and vocals.
<p>Then a waltz came on. Richard holds out his hand. Marie smiles. "Really?
Here?
<br>With all that is d takes his hand. They are wearing threadbare clothes
they
<br>tried to keep neat, Marie's curly black bob had a few flyaway hairs,
but they
<br>danced like they were wearing fucking tuxedos and ball gowns. They
seem so
<br>happy, moving to the music, being together.
<p>I was never happy dancing.
<p>"I'd like to dance too." It takes me seconds to look in the direction
of that
<br>statement.
<p>"Tim? What are you talking about? The only woman here is Marie-Pascale.
If you
<br>want to go across town to get Louise . . ."
<p>"No, Danny, I want to dance with you."
<p>Tim can be so naive, so I decide to set him straight about ballroom
dancing.
<br>"Let me explain . . ."
<p>"Actually," cuts in Richard, "sometimes in secondary school, the guys
would
<br>practice dancing together. All you really need is a leader and a follower."
<br>Thanks for the support, you know I hate dancing.
<p>"So," Tim continues, "I'll follow, you lead. You've done this before,
right?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"So, get up, this song isn't going to go on forever." I stand up and
strike an
<br>exagerated waltz pose, not even trying to hide my smirk and rolling
eyes. Tim
<br>bounces up and takes my hand.
<p>Twirl, slow, quick, quick, slow. After a while, it is like riding a
bike. Then I
<br>notice how close he is to me, one hand on his narrow, sharp hip and
the other
<br>intertwined with his. He is staring down at me with sparkling eyes.
<p>I glance at Richard, expecting to see him smirking with a 'look at my
baby
<br>brother acting foolish' expression. But he is smiling, this odd genuine
joy. A
<br>shared happiness.
<p>He feels warm and smooth against me, and can I really feel his heart
against
<br>mine? I lose my train of thought in the next passage, Tim and I spin
on the
<br>floor, and suddenly I feel like a revolving planet, suspended and content
in the
<br>starry night. I am holding on to a satellite, never releasing him from
my
<br>gravitational pull.
<p>Wow. I like dancing.
<p>Attendisme: wait and see, even if you're not sure if it is worth it.
Perhaps
<br>someday I will write a book called "French for the Sarcastic." Like
that waiter
<br>snorting "Royalle!" when I left a coin for him. Sorry, but until I
find a spot
<br>to play violin this morning, that is what you're getting.
<p>I walk to the next block, going to Richard playing his accordion. "Are
we ever
<br>going to be playing out?" I say. "Playing out" is a general term for
anything
<br>more active than spying, hiding people or stashing leaflets. You know,
like
<br>shooting people.
<p>"The composers (the High Command) say that we're not ready to play the
horns
<br>(use guns)," Richard answers.
<p>"We have the horns and the reeds (bullets). I know some people who want
to play
<br>them don't know how, and some folks don't think we should play them
at all, but
<br>I'd like to be clear on what we're going to do . . . for the score,
I mean."
<br>Real suave on my part.
<p>"They're worried about the critics (arrests, executions, the usual).
Also,
<br>they're busy filling orders for the Toulousse troupe (Unoccupied Zone
<br>resisters)."
<p>"The piano player (Michel) already went to the Vichy Symphony (arrested
by the
<br>gendarmerie). I'm still worried about the set designer (Tim) being
brought in a
<br>stage hand in Munich (sent to forced labor in Germany)."
<p>"If the permission slip (fake medical excuse) is any good, he can stay
here."
<p>"Got stage directions (coded music) finished, anyway?"
<p>"One more bar (still need to scout more)."
<p>"Good. Still playing strings (using explosives) for Wagner admirers
<br>(collaborators)?"
<p>"Sometimes, other folks play (other folks using explosives). Wouldn't
want them
<br>to see only me (identify me)."
<p>"Right. I got a troupe of acrobats (Jewish people looking to escape)
to audition
<br>(hide then smuggle out of the city)."
<p>"Small troupe? (Are they children?)"
<p>"Most of them--the larger troupes (adults) are already called to Munich
<br>(deported to Germany)."
<p>"Is the seamstress auditioning (Is Tatiana hiding them)?"
<p>"No, but her friends are."
<p>"I understand. She was late the last time (had a visit from the gendermerie)."
<p>"Going to the Propagandastaffel?" Every new piece we play out has be
approved by
<br>them, which is fine because we aren't the ones who usually submit them.
<p>"No, no new material," says Richard. Then he nudges me. A small child
holds out
<br>her hand.
<p>I have this habit with beggars interrupting. I smile wide and crazed
and say,
<br>"Did your mother ever teach you it is not polite to listen to other
people's
<br>conversations?"
<p>"I have no mother now," the child replies. I sigh and grab one more
coin from my
<br>pocket, handing it to her. The child smiles shyly and runs.
<p>"At least you did not grab it out of my case like the last time," Richard
<br>mutters.
<p>I see Vatos walking as fast as a short person could down the street.
He mutters
<br>apologies when he bumps into people. Richard just keeps on playing.
<p>"Alla," Vatos whispers to us when he comes near, "have you seen Alla?
I saw her
<br>this morning; she said she was visiting her uncle. No one I've talked
to have
<br>seen her."
<p>Alla and Vatos: I think their idea of courtship was arguing about the
march of
<br>history and the necessity of the state. Nevertheless, they were smitten
with
<br>each other, cooing and affectionate as possible in the shadows.
<p>So I try to be helpful. "Last time I saw Alla was when she checked in
after
<br>dropping love letters (leaving behind pamphlets)."
<p>Vatos sighs. "What could have happened to her?"
<p>Richard isn't as helpful. "Called to Munich?"
<p>"Oh please don't say that. She doesn't know the season schedule (future
plans of
<br>the Clowns), but she knows the flamenco troupe (Spanish refugees) and
choir
<br>(some other partisans)."
<p>He didn't say anything about torture or forced labor, but we all knew
what was
<br>on his mind. Rescuing Alla from the pits of the Gestapo or whomever.
Great. I
<br>could forbid it, but I understand the urge.
<p>"How are you going to avoid being called to Munich? You could also be
sent home
<br>(deported to Spain)."
<p>Vatos shrugs. Maybe in his own way, he is having second thoughts.
<p>Rescue--that's why we are all here, hiding, lying about ages, religions,
<br>families, and nations. Never mind the little voice wondering if it
is enough.
<p>After playing the violin in another block, I stay again with the O'Neils,
this
<br>time alone. Okay, not entirely alone.
<p>Malina and Lourdes, both small girls, one blonde and one brunette, tip-toed
to
<br>me. "Uncle Danny, where's everyone else," Malina, the brunette whispers.
<p>Why they call me Uncle, I will never know. Then again, they are finding
family
<br>wherever they can. Their mother was unfortunately Dutch and Jewish,
taken away
<br>to Velodrome d'Hiver, to Drancy and then God knows where. Lourdes,
by the way,
<br>was the name of the midwife. That's how the youngest got her name.
<p>"In different houses," I answer.
<p>"Will you read us a bedtime story? Madame O'Neil has lots of books,
but she and
<br>Monsiuer O'Neil need to sleep early."
<p>"Of course."
<p>"Thank you," I suddenly hear.
<p>Sirvart Vamgraian O'Neil stands there, a gentle grin lighting her overwise
<br>serious face. Never mind how much money they have, she dresses in a
faded yellow
<br>dress with her black curls in a tight bun. "Also, I was told to give
you this."
<br>She hands me an envelope. "An old friend, the usher told me." An usher
is a
<br>smuggler in this code.
<p>"Thank you."
<p>Sirvart then frowns, her dark eyes clouding. "I've been reading the
papers
<br>lately. They say the deportees, they're being treated horribly. L'Humanitie
<br>says--and I don't know if it's true--they're testing poison gas on
Jews."
<p>"I don't know. My dad said during the Great War, you'd think the French
were
<br>stealing away German women and having them dishonored. Best word to
use, there
<br>are children here."
<p>"Momma cups our ears if she says something she does not want us to hear,"
Malina
<br>offers.
<p>I shake my head. "I won't even go into what some folks still believe
happens
<br>during Passover. I am not certain of these stories, rumors seem to
be thick
<br>here."
<p>Sirvart nods. "But you don't want to be caught."
<p>"No."
<p>"The stories seem to be the same thing--deportees are getting killed,
especially
<br>the Jewish ones. If it is true--I can't see it myself, the Jerrys need
all the
<br>help they can get--we can't keep our mouths shut about this. Never
mind the
<br>press controls, someone has to write this down, let the world know."
<p>"You are adamant about this."
<p>"Daniel, my mother told me stories about her family being slaughtered
by the
<br>Turks. She only did it because I asked; otherwise she would just try
to forget
<br>it. But others are forgetting too. Someone told me Hitler said 'Who
remembers
<br>the Armenians these days?'"
<p>Her eyes cloud more. "Worst than dying before your time is being forgotten."
She
<br>looks at the girls. "I forgot myself. I am sorry. This is no topic
for
<br>children."
<p>"Their mother was deported. It will be part of their lives, if it is
true."
<p>"I hope the stories aren't true," Malina suddenly says, "I hope she's
all
<br>right."
<p>"Me too," I say to her, giving her a faint grin.
<p>Sirvart shakes her head. "I should not worry you. Go, read them a story."
<p>In the study, Malina and Lourdes argue over requests. Malina wanted
"Hop-Frog"
<br>and Lourdes wanted "the Cinderella where the toes get cut off."
<p>"Why do you like these stories? We are worried about scaring you with
talk of
<br>deportation, but you just seem like bloody stories." Maybe I am telling
on
<br>myself.
<p>Malina shrugs. "You get scared, but then it's all over. Nothing in those
stories
<br>are real."
<p>Yes, but the war is real. The deportations are real. Any escape is good
for us.
<br>I am not certain if I can keep these girls alive to see a world where
the only
<br>things to worry about are phantoms.
<p>"Cinderella" wins out, and then the girls fall asleep. I open the envelope.
The
<br>letter is just numbers. This looks very familiar.
<p>Herr Professor Acker and I wrote encrypted notes to each other during
holidays,
<br>before his engagement. Due to his obsession with all things Greco-Roman,
we used
<br>the Polybius checkerboard. Oh, it could be decrypted, but it was useful
for
<br>simple love letters between a student and a teacher.
<p>I was curious. Why now? What is he going to say? Why am I willing to
give up
<br>sleep to read a letter from someone I never thought I'd see again?
<p>Then I rationalized. He is still in Germany, seeing things I only hear
on the
<br>radio and read in smuggled newspapers. What will he say?
<p>Besides, only one person knows about him.
<p>"If I don't see a beheading soon, I am leaving," mutters Richard as
he holds
<br>Marie closer. A friend of Richard just wrote a play for Le Theatre
du Grand
<br>Guignol and invited the three of us to see it. Oddly enough, They spend
the time
<br>giggling and holding on to each other when killing begins.
<p>I try to keep my eyes on this epic of beheaded aristocrats avenging
themselves
<br>on their executors' descendents, but I keep remembering the argument
Tim and I
<br>had. It started as a matter of cues and design, then it just . . .slid.
Finally,
<br>Tim blurted out, "I don't understand what you want, hell, I don't know
what you
<br>want at all. Then he stuttered apologies and I snarled something about
Richard
<br>leaving.
<p>I was not enjoying much of this, just watching Marie and Richard close
together.
<br>Tatiana is watching Louis tonight; they haven't a free night since
Louis was
<br>born. I ought to be smug, content with having no children, no obligations
beyond
<br>the cast and the composing.
<p>I should be happy being alone. I'm not.
<p>I really fucked it up this time. He will run from the snarling. Unbidden,
a list
<br>of names, Isolde, Pierre, Andromache, Karl, Jean-Anton, Grazia-Zippora.
Let's
<br>talk about my favorite Italian Israelite. Grazia-Zipporah wondered
in that
<br>chirpy 'I never been outside of Venice before I went to Sorbonne with
my first
<br>husband the professor' voice why I never went to services. "Well, darling,
the
<br>whole 'man laying down with man' thing is sort of a deal-breaker on
their part"
<br>did not make her happy. She probably married another nice professor.
They’re
<br>probably happy.
<p>Then I wind into the facilities. Oh god, not him, just washing his hands,
and I
<br>swear his eyes were not focused on the mirror.
<p>"Timothe&eacute;, what are you doing here?"
<p>"Washing my hands." He grabbed a towel. "I bought a ticket."
<p>"And do you normally come here?"
<p>"I didn't really expect to see you here. Maybe I should not be surprised."
He
<br>shrugs and turns. "Anyway, I'm sorry."
<p>Where did that come from? "For what?"
<p>"I really didn't mean to be so, you know, mule-like. A lot of things
going
<br>through my head."
<p>I smelled church incense on his coat. "I thought you were an atheist."
<p>Now those eyes were focused on me. "I was taking my grandmother to church.
Rites
<br>of unction." His eyes clouded dark. "She's dying."
<p>"I'm so sorry," I whispered, because it seemed the right thing to say.
"What . .
<br>.could you tell me about her?"
<p>"I lived with her since I was twelve until I moved in with Louise. My
mother and
<br>father were too busy with his work, thought the culture would be good
for me,
<br>the climate, I always was so sick in England."
<p>"I thought you were French."
<p>"I am, my father is English, I never really liked England, though. I
never
<br>really like him." Strange how much hurt and anger were in those plain
spoken
<br>sentences, and how does he know he could trust me so much to tell me?
I am
<br>almost afraid for him.
<p>"So, you haven't talked to your parents."
<p>"No. Grandmere is the only family I have." No, I wanted to say, I could
be your
<br>family, the cast of the cabaret, we could. Maybe I was offering too
much, so I
<br>kept silent.
<p>I did not keep silent for long. "I guess I was too harsh too. It's going
to
<br>sound so stupid . . ."
<p>"Go on."
<p>"I thought I scared you."
<p>"How?"
<p>"Snarling. Sarcasm."
<p>"I remember you were warning me against sleeping with you."
<p>"Yes. Yes, I was."
<p>"Why? Really, why?"
<p>"You know how I was your first?"
<p>"You are, sort of, I mean, Louise, I did do some things, I think someone
at
<br>ENCAD, but he left for the army . . ."
<p>I nodded. "Here is the short version. I had a first. He left me. Never
mind I
<br>had many others between the two of you. I don't know if I will ever
get over
<br>being rejected."
<p>He tilted his head. "Why would I ever do that? Other people have, but
I cannot
<br>see why I would." He stared more. "Tell me about him, I mean, if you
want."
<p>"He was a classics professor at the gymnazium I attended, much like
your lyc&eacute;e,
<br>preparation for university. He made me feel accepted, cared for. That
was what
<br>made him leaving so hard."
<p>"I like your eyes," Tim suddenly said. Now there's a change of subject.
He
<br>continues, "I finally mixed the right amount of green and brown paint
for the
<br>colour. It was hard. Your eyes are not like the others."
<p>He kissed on the cheek. "It must hurt to feel so alone, when someone
you love
<br>leaves." He bent his head down, staring at the tiled floor. "I don't
know.
<br>Grandmere is the first person I know who is . . .well, you know. Few
stay around
<br>long enough for me to feel anything before they leave."
<p>He's hurting, I'm hurting, and we both could be asking for too much,
expecting
<br>too much. I felt afraid, like I always do before I light up a firecracker
as a
<br>kid. It may be a surprise for Richard and Heinrich if they heard that,
<br>considering how often I did. However, I knew, even then, I only had
so many
<br>chances before I blow my fingers and god-knows-what off, before someone
gets his
<br>heart broken.
<p>Yet I still light the fuse; I still reached out and kissed him back.
He grabbed
<br>my hand and leads me into a stall. Inside, we kissed blindly and grinded
against
<br>the cold faux-marble wall. He put his hands on the back of my head,
and then
<br>bucked against me, steady and increasing in speed. Just as suddenly,
he stopped,
<br>shuddering and breathing hard.
<p>"Are you all right?" He nodded.
<p>"What about you?"
<p>"Later, is that good for you?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Do you need me to clean you up?" He nodded again, tight with a flushed
face. I
<br>unzipped his pant, pulled down and licked the fluids. He tasted strange,
like
<br>swallowing the sea.
<p>Then he turned me up and around, pulling me close to his chest. Unzipping
my
<br>pants, he wrapped those damnable long and pale fingers around my cock.
He gave
<br>the head a gentle press, then he stroked slow and long. I lurched into
his hand
<br>so hard, that I thought my spectacles would fall off. I came quick
and gasping,
<br>pouring into his hand.
<p>Cannot believe I remembered that much. Taking a piece of paper from
a nearby
<br>drawer, I work from memory, writing down the corresponding Greek letters.
I am
<br>little surprised I remembered this much from my classics education.
I hoped that
<br>I could still read Greek, that the prizes I won weren't just flukes.
Come to
<br>think of it, I fear that too.
<p>The message is written, and I begin translating it in my head. The first
word
<br>was 'Diogenes.' A small nickname he called me, the rejecting all status
for
<br>truth and looking for an honest man with a lamp in broad daylight and
all.
<p>Diogenes,
<br>It is good you are not here. A student betrayed me to the authorities.
My wife
<br>is left as a widow without ceremony. Here where I am detained, all
hunger and
<br>thirst, all work until muscles ache. I weep for the Sons of Israel:
they are
<br>given Lethean waters before all of us, and those who survive, still
drink.
<p>Epimetheus
<p>Lethean waters . . .the River Lethe . . .in the underworld.
<p>The rumors are true.
<p>Oh God, no.
<p>We are the Little Folk We!
<br>Too little to love or to hate.
<br>But leave us alone and you'll see
<br>How we can drag down the State!
<br>--Rudyard Kipling
<p>The chimney sweep walks on the rooftop, one step in front of the other.
Behind
<br>him, Rabbi Asimov crawls, holding on to the coattails.
<p>Weiss, the chimney sweep, was amused. "After a while, you're not afraid
of the
<br>heights."
<p>"I'm more afraid of getting caught," Rabbi Asimov replied. He holds
a small
<br>telescope, just powerful enough to see dimmer stars. It was just enough
to bring
<br>down the wrath of Jacob Gens if he ever found out. As Police Chief
Gens sees it,
<br>Rabbi Asimov was there by the grace of God and the mercy of the Nazi
<br>authorities. With the leading lights taken East, a scholar has to stay
in Vilna
<br>to maintain normalcy. As long as his eccentricities are harmless and
legal, his
<br>small household stays. Rabbi Asimov was well aware that if it came
down to Gens
<br>turning over him and any harm coming to the ghetto inhabitants, he
would be
<br>turned over.
<p>He is risking much coming out here, but he could not keep away from
the stars
<br>anymore than he can keep away from his books. That was what got him
expelled as
<br>rosh yeshiva some years ago. He heard word of meteors, perhaps true,
maybe
<br>already gone. The Nazis monitor any mail, even about incandescent dust,
so news
<br>is now by word of mouth and a smuggled letter.
<p>He focuses on Kochab, on Sadir, Cassiopeia. No sign. After that, Rabbi
Asimov
<br>focuses the telescope on the ground. "They're coming."
<p>Weiss opens his black bag and empties out his cleaning equipment. He
smiles and
<br>shows the empty bag to Rabbi Asimov. Weiss asks, "Enough room?" Rabbi
Asimov
<br>nods.
<p>After receiving the goods, Rabbi Asimov goes downstairs. In a candlelit
room
<br>with covered mirrors, a slender woman with large brown eyes and dark
hair sits
<br>alone. He stands in the doorway, facing her.
<p>"Naomi-Chaiya," Rabbi Asimov whispers, "we have food. After Shifra and
I give
<br>some out, we will get you breakfast tomorrow."
<p>"Breakfast, haven't had that in a long time."
<p>Rabbi Asimov nods and pauses. "Your uncle was a good man."
<p>Naomi-Chaiya replies softly, "He died of natural causes. That is rare
these
<br>days."
<p>She turns her head and sighs. Perhaps she is thinking of her father.
Rabbi
<br>Asimov did not want to remind Naomi-Chaiya of her father. A few days
after her
<br>seventeenth birthday, she and her father were rounded up in the action
of the
<br>yellow passes. Then they found themselves in Ponar. She was separated,
forced to
<br>undress, then shot. Somehow, she survived, climbed out of the pit,
wandered,
<br>then was found by foragers. Shifra gave her old clothes, a place to
stay until
<br>her uncle (with work outside of the ghetto) came to pick her up.
<p>Since then, she has kept to herself, reading, sometimes watching for
smugglers
<br>delivering food. Tonight, her eyes brighten.
<p>"My brother, he left before the Nazis came. He was leaving for England,
from
<br>Paris, I believe . I think I can get there."
<p>Rabbi Asimov worries, "But surely, you will be caught. Perhaps killed."
<p>"There are good reasons to go. My uncle is gone, there is nothing holding
me
<br>here. If I stay here, I will be killed. We all will, I know it. I know
there
<br>will be more people sent to Ponar, maybe even other places." Her voice
trembles,
<br>but her eyes are straight-ahead and shining.
<p>Rabbi Asimov sighs. "I know."
<p>"So why do you not leave?"
<p>"If there is a way to save others from this fate, I am willing to do
whatever I
<br>need to, whatever is possible without bringing more harm to others.
I am old, I
<br>lived a long time, I much rather that I die in service to the others."
<p>He smiles. "Perhaps I am wrong to doubt you. I wish you much success
in your
<br>journey. Tell Yehuda I say hello. And Daniel, if he is still alive.
Leonard says
<br>he is indeed. I wonder how Daniel's father is doing . . ." Rabbi Asimov
walks
<br>away, remembering when he was just Issac, a tutor in between studies,
and Meyer
<br>Elfman was a thirteen year old from Kiev now in Berlin, yet to have
two sons.

<p>If you had been some poor demented fool
<br>I might have had some reason to complain,

<br>or else you want damnation more than bliss.
<br>--Francois Villon
<p>I can't sleep.
<p>I cannot fucking sleep.
<p>I feel sick, even sicker than before. Not only am I ashamed about the
people I
<br>was raised to consider my countrymen, the country I have adopted as
my own
<br>disgusts me. They are just taking it. The gendermes are taking people
to certain
<br>death, and people are doing nothing. Sometimes Marie-Pascale gets recruits
from
<br>the ration lines, Louise-Marguerite finds friends in the acting academy
and
<br>Johann connects with former patients. Everyone else just murmurs what
can be
<br>done?
<p>So they do nothing. And people die.
<p>I try to imagine where Herr Professor Acker is, but my nightmares bleed
in. I
<br>imagine dark cells full of the stench of the dead, with me choking
on something
<br>poisonous and slow. Was this what Hannah Abbandanzo, Malina and Lourdes'
mother,
<br>experienced? Was this the last sight Gittel Schneiderman saw? What
of Leon? When
<br>he is too tired for forced labor, do they put him down like a sick
dog?
<p>I am almost tempted to do nothing. Get out, run to some other place,
Spain,
<br>England, maybe Canada. Be alone, maybe in some primeval forest with
dark sky and
<br>trees, and burn all of my sheet music, my poems, old love letters and
<br>photographs. Because the things I trusted seem so useless.
<p>The important ideas get capitalized: Progress, God, Fatherland, Freedom,
Art,
<br>Civilization, so many more. In practice, they falter and decay. I've
given up on
<br>God, Torah, Fatherland and Security at seventeen. I guess I never really
gave up
<br>other ideas.
<p>Why am I surprised? Genteel words masking murder, people dying as quickly
as
<br>cars built on the assembly line, the toxic gas wielded as deftly as
the scalpel.
<br>Again, I am still surprised. People talk about paintings developing
from
<br>scratches on cave walls, of the ending of human sacrifice and curing
of
<br>diseases. Maybe somewhere I really believed things could get better.
<p>How could it be our prejudices haven't changed? Mama would tell me of
the
<br>Cossacks, Papa told me of his family expelled from Cologne, pushed
into Kiev,
<br>then bolting into Berlin. Hunted and haunted. "It's in the past now,"
they told
<br>me, "we can teach children, make friends from different places, go
to services
<br>and be no different from anyone else."
<p>Even when I realized I was different from others, I believed that the
only
<br>problems I would get were from people who did not want to develop,
to advance. I
<br>was in the right in the end, they will hum my songs or at least tolerate
them,
<br>and others will push ahead new art forms. I believed that given time,
people
<br>will discard the idea that men who take other men to bed are evil because
<br>someone long ago said so.
<p>Oh, people want to advance all right, with newer weapons and bureaucratic
terms.
<br>They just want to treat people like shit more efficiently. 'They?'
Why am I
<br>using that? I am sure that the one who turned Herr Professor Acker
was a student
<br>in my mother's class or someone who taught me history. They probably
could stop
<br>me on the street, and run for the gendermes. Or the Gestapo. New forms
of poison
<br>gas they can come up with, how to live with people different from them,
they
<br>just cannot see it.
<p>Me? Is it just about me? Other people are in danger too, or maybe not?
Richard
<br>is married to Marie, is naturalized, but how long before they figure
out the
<br>papers are fake and Germany needs more workers, before he is sent to
that
<br>nightmare cell? Vatos and Avila are already on the run, God knows where
Alla is,
<br>no one ever hears where the captured go. Tim is running from forced
labor, but
<br>how long before he is caught? Helene could be arrested for snubbing
the wrong
<br>wolf-whistling solider.
<p>Will there be another round up just where Richard and Marie are staying?
Is
<br>Louis going to be taken away, screaming and crying?
<p>Will there be another Paragraph 175? Oh sure, I cannot get in trouble
just for
<br>holding hands with Timothe&eacute;, but how long will that last?
<p>And what of the little girls, sleeping in the next room?
<p>After the Jews and the leftists are taken away, swept clean from France
like so
<br>much dust, who's next? Helene suspects it will be the Gypsies. There
have
<br>already been rumors of arrests, not for stealing or loitering, but
for being
<br>around.
<p>If I leave, no one will know. Nothing will stand in their way.
<p>Perhaps I wasted enough time thinking, should make an effort to sleep.
Someone
<br>needs to take the girls to the next safe house on their way to Spain,
and I need
<br>all my energy.
<p>I have to stand in their way.
<p>Sunrise wakes me up, pink light pouring through the window. Staying
away from
<br>the window, I unpack my violin case. Spectacles, pistol, and miraculously
clean
<br>shirt are in there. I change and fold my worn shirt in a compartment
in the
<br>lining.
<p>Curse my sensitive ears. I hear murmuring. Paul O'Neil speaking lilting
<br>Irish-accented French and gruffer voices. Oh damn, the kids! The strange
men are
<br>asking about Malina and Lourdes. They got to get out of here. I grab
my violin
<br>case and shoes, walking as soft as possible.
<p>In the hallway, Sirvart is holding my hat and jacket with two sleepy
girls
<br>holding clothes to change in. "Put this on quick," she says low and
soft handing
<br>me the jacket. After put them on, I'm about to put on the shoes when
she shakes
<br>her head. "Not now. Wait until you're at the door."
<p>I nod and she bends down to the girls. "Change quickly." She then looks
up at
<br>me. "Turn around." I shrug and do what she says. The other voices get
louder
<br>talking over Paul, telling him if he doesn't let them upstairs, he
will be
<br>arrested.
<p>"You can turn around now." Sirvart stands up and faces all of us. "Servant's
<br>enterance is right down. You won't be spotted; they're asleep until
eight. I'll
<br>take Malina, you take Lourdes. You have the most similar colouring.
There's a
<br>good chance they're looking for a pair of girls, so it's best to take
separate
<br>routes to the safe-house." She pats Malina's gray coat. "Necessary
papers are in
<br>their coats. Lourdes knows the address, and she's carrying a map."
<p>Lourdes bounces up to me and hands me a cap. I make my best effort at
tucking
<br>her long blonde hair into there, and just about manage to do so. "Madame
O'Neil
<br>would of braided my hair, but she didn't have time," she whispers to
me.
<p>"Good luck," Sirvart whispers.
<p>"I'll see you later," Malina says with a child's optimism. Lourdes and
I run
<br>down the stairs, putting on our shoes before going out the door.
<p>Flat against the wall of the next house, Lourdes shows me the route
and the
<br>Metro station near the safehouse. We then stroll down the street.
<p>We've been criss-crossing arrondissements all morning, when I start
to feel very
<br>hungry. So did Lourdes. Fortunately, she did not need to use the water
closet.
<br>There's a cafe nearby, so we walk toward it.
<p>Halfway through her milk, my fake coffee and the beignets we're sharing,
I start
<br>to feel watched. Everyone is calm, relaxed, having a mid-morning break,
but
<br>there's this one guy in a table across from us. Nothing odd about him,
graying,
<br>slight, and in a rumpled suit. He glares at us, cigarette dangling
from his
<br>lips. Occasionally, he glances at the street.
<p>He can't be watching us . . .what for? But he is.
<p>I pull out the money for the waiter. "Finish your milk, we're leaving,"
I murmur
<br>to Lourdes. I don't know what I am doing after, but I have to get us
out of
<br>here.
<p>Lourdes looks at me confused, but she drinks her milk and gets up. I
glance
<br>behind me to see the man look to the side and nod.
<p>As I walk, the plan takes shape. I'll get lost. I walk through the cafe
gate,
<br>going back on the street, staying close to the pedestrian crowd. Lourdes
holds
<br>my hand, her small hand shaking. I think she feels something's wrong
too.
<p>I glance to my side and see an odd sight on the other side of the street.
Four
<br>big men stride down the street, unshaven with rumpled suits. Myrmidons
of Paris.
<br>They are across Lourdes and I, looking at us at times. I adjust my
cap. Better
<br>keep my hair in, not give them any markers.
<p>I walk straight, trying to move closer to the crowd, to look like just
a nobody
<br>going somewhere they don't know about. The next time I glance, they
aren't
<br>looking at me, just at the corner, deciding somehow we weren't what
we were
<br>looking for.
<p>Lourdes and I get close, just about to be swallowed by the crowd. We
get behind
<br>someone with a long box holding who knows what. He brings up the box,
closer to
<br>his armpit, the edge of the box catching the edge of Lourdes' cap.
I try to put
<br>my hand on her cap, but down it drifts, Lourdes' blonde curls spilling
<br>everywhere. That's when the men turn around and start walking toward
us. I grab
<br>Lourdes, holding her close to my chest and run through the crowd.
<p>There was a jostling and a shouting but at least I got a good head-start.
The
<br>four men are still at it, pushing people out of the way. Focus on the
Metro
<br>station; it's just a few minutes. Pace. If I can just get on before
they catch
<br>me . . .Lourdes is breathing hard and shaking. She shouldn't be this
frightened
<br>this young.
<p>I keep running, though pacing myself, cutting a corner ahead. They still
keep at
<br>it. One of them yells, "You can't run forever. Give up. Give us the
girl."
<p>His smaller colleague adds, "If you give us no trouble, maybe we won't
make you
<br>drop your trousers. Twice the Jews, twice the money."
<p>Fuck off, gentlemen. I grab Lourdes tighter and surge ahead. I see an
empty
<br>crate near my right hand. I push it hard down the street in front of
them. They
<br>stumble and jostle, and I can run at a steadier pace.
<p>A part of me is amused by the situation. A rootless atheist fucking
a man
<br>holding the blonde daughter of an ex-prostitute. Ask a rabbi, he'd
say we've
<br>gone astray; ask a respectable businessman in Rosh Hashanah services,
he
<br>wouldn't know if we were Jews at all. I never thought about it, never
attended
<br>services after I was 17, have no restrictions on what I eat, touch
whomever I
<br>want. But, hey, we're Jewish enough for those thugs.
<p>There's a crowd ahead getting into the Metro, so I slow down and try
to glide
<br>in. Lourdes loops her arm over mine and fishes two tokens from her
pocket. She
<br>clasps them in her hand as I run down stairs, holding her even more
tightly as I
<br>go two at a time. One of them lunges at Lourdes' coat. She slaps him
hard on the
<br>hand, and he tumbles down the stairs. His colleagues slow down to help
him up.
<br>We keep going.
<p>Lourdes first drops the tokens in, I slide through the turnstile and
then move
<br>through the thick crowd. Just in case, I take off my cap and place
it on
<br>Lourdes' head. Maybe a slight change of appearance might help.
<p>The train comes and we move with the crowd. This train might not be
our train. I
<br>don't care. I glance and see the pursuers arguing with the token collector.
I
<br>resist smugness and step on the train.
<p>We spend the afternoon switching cars, switching lines, until we reach
the next
<br>safe-house. The hostess shows Lourdes her room, and then cuts my hair.
When she
<br>brushes the last strands of my hair, now just above the collar, she
mutters
<br>"Someone is waiting for you in the attic. He says he's got some news
for you."
<p>I nod and walk with her.
<p>It was Sluggo, ducking below the attic frame and holding my duffel bag.
"Hey."
<p>I look at him sideways. "Hello."
<p>"We're getting deported, so I figured I'd get your things. You left
them at our
<br>apartment, you know, when you were submitting articles."
<p>"What happened?"
<p>"You know how we have to register? Every day? Being enemy aliens and
all?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Well, we were all there, long line too. Had to wake up real early."
<p>I nod. He will get to the end.
<p>"Jane was reaching for the necessary items in her purse, and her pamphlets
fell
<br>out. The guards did a search on us. Fortunately, the folks were feeling
nice.
<br>First offence. We could have been shot."
<p>I shrug. Maybe it had to happen. Like he said, at least they didn't
get shot.
<p>"I have to go. The gendermerie think this is just a brothel. I don't
want to
<br>stay too long."
<p>I nod.
<p>Before he walks away, he says, "Don't worry, Danny, we'll find a way
to get back
<br>to Paris."
<p>I can't really cry for him. Yes, deportation is a pain, but at least
he won't be
<br>arrested on sight if he comes to America. He has someplace to come
home to.
<p>I take my gun out of my pants and hold it for a while. I could have
taken it
<br>out, aimed at those men chasing after Lourdes and me. Then again, what
if they
<br>had weapons of their own. Last thing I wanted was Lourdes in the line
of fire.
<br>When it is just me, vulnerable, sure I could do it. I am almost frightened
that
<br>I enjoy the idea. Is this is what the occupation reduced me to?
<p>Never mind. I am alive now. I need to go to places.
<p>Sometime that afternoon, Johann held a transcript. What started as a
routine
<br>inquiry about frostbite and fingertip detaching became something else
when the
<br>solider started opening a bottle of vodka. "Vodka's the only good thing
I
<br>remember from Moscow, Herr Doktor Denbort," the solider muttered. A
nice quiet
<br>job at a desk in Paris is his reward. Johann noticed even when drunk,
the
<br>solider addressed "Herr Docktor Denbort."
<p>As Johann transcribes the procedures of the examination, the solider
goes about
<br>talking about how good it is to speak to another Bohemian, to not be
afraid of
<br>what he talks about. Then he leans up, vodka fumes in Johann's face,
and
<br>whispers, "You want to know why I am drinking so much? I wasn't always
in
<br>Moscow. I first went to Poland. Barns burning. Whole villages shot.
Gypsies
<br>stripped and dragged. Einsatzgruppen--brutal to all, especially to
the Jews."
<br>The whisper becomes drier, and he continues, "You know what they're
doing to
<br>those poor devils back East?"
<p>Johann did not transcribe any personal information about the patient
before.
<br>Today, he did.
<p>After Sluggo left, I said goodbye to Lourdes. Malina still wasn't there,
and I
<br>fear the worst. What has happened to her? What about Sirvart?
<p>I had nothing to do but busk. I have no idea if I even want to play
music, but
<br>really, staying here would just get me arrested or drive me insane.
So I wear my
<br>coat and hat, and walk with my violin case and duffel bag.
<p>The dry fruit is still good, so that becomes my lunch. Hell, who cares
about
<br>meal times? Anything edible at any time is good. Time to play the old
standards.
<p>I go through the motions, giving them the three B's: Bach, Beethoven
and Brahms
<br>on violin. I bet the people can hear it: my tips are horrible.
<p>After one more violin sonata, I started playing something. Somehow it
started as
<br>a reference to a medieval chanson, recalling the jongleurs, the poor
musicians
<br>on the fringes of society. I remembered Helene, who traveled from Bretagne
to
<br>play in an orchestra, but Occupation happened, and Christine the country
girl,
<br>who recites and pick pockets because she doesn't want to go back. Then,
there is
<br>me, the latest in a grand fucking tradition.
<p>Con ira. With staccato, slides, dissonance, appergi, and an occasional
detache,
<br>I imagined slapping the face of every one of the passerbys, for letting
these
<br>deaths happen, for feeling hounded in the one city I thought was home,
a temper
<br>tantrum, a veiled bride with a shrapnel-scarred face.
<p>Con affecionata. Lourdes comes to mind, with her blonde hair and frightened
<br>silence. Somewhere, in the legato tones and dying and rising of the
notes,
<br>there's hope. Hope that Lourdes outlives Hitler and all the people
he commands.
<br>Hope that she becomes everything she wants to be. Hope that the world
she lives
<br>in will be peaceful, free, and understanding. Hope I never thought
I would have.
<p>Strange, I thought of giving up music, but it's the thing I grab on
to. I didn't
<br>care if the listeners liked it, but judging by the fact my violin case
runs
<br>over, maybe they did. I am almost tempted to transcribe it. I don't.
That would
<br>be like showing a stranger a love letter, though. Or maybe an unsent
tirade.
<p>I leave the corner at dusk, wondering who is taking care of the group
take for
<br>today. Louise's apartment, of course. I know where she's staying, not
far from
<br>here.
<p>In the teeth of Things forbid
<br>And Reason overthrown,
<br>Helen stood by me, she did,
<br>Helen all alone!
<br>--Rudyard Kipling
<p>I want to go with the one I love.
<br>I do not want to calculate the cost.
<br>I do not want to think about whether it's good.
<br>I do not want to know whether he loves me.
<br>I want to go with whom I love.
<br>--Bertolt Brecht
<p>Louise is there, so is Marie, Richard, Tim and Christine. All are surprised
with
<br>my take.
<p>"Why didn't you write that song down," Marie asks.
<p>Because they don't deserve it. "I guess I was too involved in playing
to think
<br>about it."
<p>She nods and rubs her ankle.
<p>Somehow I become aware that my legs burned. All that running and walking,
<br>somehow it never occured to me that I would need to do more than sit
on a stool
<br>for a few hours. We decide on sleeping arrangements, with Richard staying
<br>somewhere else to transcribe radio broadcasts, Marie delivering something
or
<br>other to an acquaintance and Christine couriering. Louise is visiting
a friend.
<br>Tim is just going to finish some pamphlets and go to bed.
<p>"I have an announcement to make, but I want everyone here before I do."
<p>Richard nods. "Funny thing too, Johann said the same thing. I wonder
what could
<br>that be." Can't be anything like what I have.
<p>Somehow, even with my legs and the perpetual insomnia, I want something
to do.
<br>"You sure you folks don't need me for anything?"
<p>"Nah, I work faster alone," Christine says smiling.
<p>Richard shrugs. "I think you've done more than enough with the busking.
Go to
<br>sleep."
<p>I walk around the small dark apartment like the last small dark apartment
the
<br>two of them had and grab a cot in the corner. As the apartment becomes
quieter,
<br>the usual murmur of thoughts gets louder. Is this all in vain?
<p>Minutes later, Tim walks in. "You're not asleep."
<p>I shrug. "You're not working."
<p>"Hand is cramping. Besides, there is no rush. I don't sleep until after
I finish
<br>drawing." And forging I note to myself.
<p>He sits down beside the cot, knees sticking out and chin resting in
his hands.
<br>"You look awful."
<p>"I always look awful."
<p>He shakes his head. "Not tired awful, frightened awful."
<p>"It's about the announcement."
<p>He looks up at me. "How can I help you?"
<p>I never been asked that before, and I am not sure what to say. My whole
body
<br>aches, but I deal with things alone, or at least I did.
<p>I'm almost too ashamed to say it. "Hold me. Be beside me."
<p>He stands up and lays a hand on my head. "It's easier on my bed, you
know. I
<br>mean, you don't want to be stabbed by my elbows or anything."
<p>I sigh. "Fine by me."
<p>So he leads me to his narrow bed and puts his arms around me as we lie
down. His
<br>right hand cradles my head and his left cradles my shoulders. I slide
down,
<br>resting my head on his chest. I stay like this for a while, his thin
shirt and
<br>warmth against my cheek, his heartbeat against my ear, mixed with the
sound of
<br>our breathing.
<p>I don't know when I started talking, but I did. I didn't just talk about
the
<br>background, the rumors, the stories in resistance papers, Herr Professor
Acker's
<br>letter and Lourdes. I talked about fear. It's one thing to play with
explosives,
<br>hide pamphlets and insult the easily offended, but that's nothing compared
to
<br>the fear of being forgotten. The melodies I worked so hard on being
forgotten,
<br>of all those people with no names and obscure burial places. That entire
<br>struggle and having nothing to show for it. I am afraid I will die
forgotten
<br>more than dying.
<p>Now, it is not just me that might be forgotten, not just Jewish people,
not just
<br>Gypsies. One by one, any group the Hitlerites decide to erase dying
forgotten.
<p>After my monologue, Tim says nothing at first. "Well, I can't forget
you." I
<br>raise my head, looking at his face. I've never seen him look like this
before.
<br>His eyes are wide and scared, but his jaw was firm with pursed lips.
<p>"Three people," he says finally.
<p>"Yes?"
<p>"Three people who accept me, who don't interrupt me when I ramble, can't
finish
<br>what I'm saying, you know how it is, three people who like whatever
I draw, even
<br>if, well, it isn't what they wanted at first, three people who feed
me, who know
<br>I'm not frail and weak all the time, but love me when I feel that way,
you
<br>know?"
<p>Be patient, I tell myself, he's got something to say and he will say
it.
<br>"Grandmere, Louise and you. Grandmere is gone. Her name, I took it,
that's all I
<br>have left of her, and some stuff she gave me, but I took her name.
You and
<br>Louise, all I have left. Bastards have art, have more food than us,
but they're
<br>not taking you away from me."
<p>So you weren't born L'Avigne. Interesting. "This . . .You could go back
to
<br>school."
<p>"And it wouldn't be like it was before. Nothing's the way it was before
<br>occupation. Shit, I didn't think they'd arrest kids, or kill people
because
<br>they're this way or that way. Not in 1942. Why are we in these categories
<br>anyway? It's like school. You're smart or you're dumb, you're talented
or you're
<br>not, you're athletic or you're not. Why are we so mean to each other
because of
<br>stupid shit?"
<p>"I don't know."
<p>"I could help you. I could, you know, scout. Warn. Entertain smuggled
kids. I
<br>make good silly faces." He smiles and shrugs.
<p>"Give direction?"
<p>"If you want. I mean, you're probably more used to being ordered around
by your
<br>brother."
<p>I chuckle, because it is funny, and I am glad I find something funny
despite the
<br>bullshit.
<p>I get serious for a moment. "You think . . . you think we'll succeed?
What if
<br>the 'Thousand Year Reich' really lasts that long? They'll call us terrorists."
<p>"Then you'll be remembered by the children that the children of the
children,
<br>you know, fifty generations, all those children, all those adults,
rescued.
<br>They'll tell people about us in whispers. When Paris is finally free,
maybe not
<br>now, maybe not even by Christmas, you'll be remembered as someone who
ran fast
<br>and had this kindness, even though you snarl and mock. You . . .maybe
as a
<br>hero."
<p>He kissed me on the lips, soft and chaste. "A hero. Yeah. And I'll be
remembered
<br>as the babbling idiot who drew better than he talked, who followed
you
<br>everywhere. Who had every reason not to, but they did it because it
was right
<br>and good. Because I loved you."
<p>"I think history will remember you more kindly than you think," I add
with a
<br>faint grin. I didn't want to believe what he was saying. Somehow, however,
I
<br>wanted to try.
<p>I kiss Tim as I drift into sleep, on lips, forehead and throat. He strokes
my
<br>hair and sometimes nibbles on my ear. I sleep. Even if things are now
worse, I
<br>can survive. We can survive.
<p>Somehow, Johann's announcement and mind coincide. Two different people,
two
<br>different paths, differing in details and perspective. Two witnesses
with one
<br>warning.
<p>Everyone has their opinion. "The Boches are fucking barbarians," Helene
growls.
<br>She never says things like that in front of Johann. Any prejudice and
derision
<br>worries Johann, however well deserved.
<p>"Barbarians at least challenge their enemy to a battle before killing
them,"
<br>Johann retorts. "The Hitlerites simply lie through their teeth."
<p>Louise looks horrified. "Those poor people! How can I make people weep
for the
<br>characters on stage when they will not weep for their neighbors?" Then
her face
<br>glows with inspiration. "I shall find a way."
<p>"I should have known," Richard says shaking his head. "I read Mein Kampf,
<br>borrowed it from a classmate in university. Everyone else thought it
was bombast
<br>and bullshit, and no one would believe this fever rambling about control
and
<br>this dark Jewish take-over of Germany. Until I was expelled first year
in law
<br>school, I believed them."
<p>"Oh, Louis!" Marie exclaims, "Not with Father and Catherine, neighbors
are
<br>collaborators, or at least gossipy. Pierre has a good job in Nantes,
but he is
<br>already warned too many times to stop mocking Petain." She sighs. "Stockholm
is
<br>the best idea. Richard's parents are there. I am told it is easier
to get papers
<br>for one child rather than one child and an adult."
<p>Vatos goes on another speech. "The businessmen and the politicians,
the priests
<br>and the bought academics, they pick on the weakest and divide us all.
Better
<br>that than see that there are better ways of life than a nation-state,
than a
<br>pecking order where the people do not get much. We've had our disagreements.
I
<br>can't tell you I understand you or the things you were taught. I consider
you a
<br>fellow musician and an ally, even if you are not my comrade. I already
face
<br>deportation and prison if I am caught. I'm proud to add aiding you
in anyway to
<br>my list of 'crimes.'"
<p>"Oh Jesus, those . . . this is wrong, so wrong and what Vatos said too,"
Avila
<br>adds with a sweet smile.
<p>"I can only imagine what they are doing in Czechoslovakia," Bartek murmurs.
"I
<br>don't understand half of what Hernandez was talking about, but I will
help you."
<br>I see Avila look at Bartek and smile.
<p>"Hey, we can take a few more guests," Christine says with a smile and
a shrug.
<p>Alla, rescued from the gendermes, nods. "I often ask myself whether
Stalin or
<br>Hitler are the most corrupt in this century. The least I can do is
make this
<br>plot one of Hitler's failures."
<p>Tatiana sighs, "I can't believe I'm agreeing with a Communist, but then
again,
<br>we live in a strange time. May the spirits help us do the right thing."
Tatiana
<br>doesn't disagree with Alla because of politics. She's dvoeverie, and
in her
<br>mind, the Communists are even worse than the Christians and the Jews.
At least
<br>the two groups respect the past, even if they don't worship her gods
and saints.
<p>"So, I guess now we rescue people from certain death," Richard says.
<p>"Out-live Hitler," I add.
<p>"Keep enjoying life even when all this shit is going on," Marie reminds.
<p>"I'll settle for two out of three," I chuckle.
