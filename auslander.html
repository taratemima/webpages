Auslander Lied
<br>Tara
<br>New friends arrive, old members leave. (R)
<p>AU Danny/Tim set in Occupied Paris, approximately November-December
1942. I know
<br>nothing about their sexual orientation, politicial opinions, personality,
or
<br>hobbies, it's all speculation here. This is rated R for m/f sex, m/m
<br>narrotophilia, violence and swearing.
<p>Ten minutes before, my sister-in-law Marie-Pascale drags me off. Here
I am
<br>wondering what the hell am I still in Paris for. Three years ago, I
closed the
<br>cabaret my brother and I opened. Still, we meet again, working against
the
<br>occupying Nazis in our own ways.
<p>I stayed because I want others to live. Because it feels nice to have
roots.
<br>Because Paris has all these talented and mad people. Because of Tim,
standing
<br>next to me with one of the smugglers delivering food, supplies, sometimes
gifts.
<p>"Think of it as a late birthday gift."
<p>The pixie-like smuggler hands a small tin box to Tim. He opens it, and
holds a
<br>small, silver, box-like object.
<p>"It's a camera," he says. "I always wondered what kind of pictures I
could make
<br>with those."
<p>"Shit," I say, "those are almost as sketchy to own as a radio." A pause.
"Good
<br>choice."
<p>"Um, what about film?" he murmurs.
<p>"Already loaded." She hands Tim three small canisters. "More here too.
You need
<br>to know how to load it. There are instructions. With pictures."
<p>Tim lowers his head and smiles. "Thank you."
<p>The rest of us have had a busy autumn. Vatos, Avila, Bartek and Alla
handle
<br>sabotage; Helene, Johann, Tatiana and Christine find places to hide
escapees,
<br>provide them with food and medicine; Richard listens to the radio,
Marie types,
<br>Louise does drop off; Tim forges and scouts, and I pass on information,
either
<br>in writing or music.
<p>Sometimes I help Vatos blow stuff up. Marie sends information about
battles and
<br>laws to Helene. Louise talks to girls in auditions. Avila hides those
like him,
<br>escapees from Spain, sometimes leading those escaping to Spain.
<p>We do things to in different capacities, for other people or on our
own. Let's
<br>see, explosive transports, hotel rooms damaged, people smuggled in
boxes and
<br>costumes, food riots, popped tires, cut telephone wires, bobby pins
and marbles
<br>in anti-aircraft guns, surprise visits to collaborators and trips through
the
<br>catacombs that ended with me sweating and shaking, but accomplished.
Still no
<br>'playing out,' but busking is still done.
<p>Foremost, ever since we found out the rumors of the death camps were
true, we've
<br>been trying to warn people. Publishing Lord Eden's promise of vengence
and the
<br>letters, graffiti and whispered warnings to old acquaintances and new
allies.
<br>Some managed to escape or hide. Others did not.
<p>Louise is hard at work at a project of her own. After graduating from
the acting
<br>academy, she went on several auditions. She stopped, however, tired
of worrying.
<br>"I couldn't take on the mantle of another time and another woman with
these men,
<br>straight-backed, beady-eyed, trying to figure out what kind of woman
I was,
<br>their minds on their girls or some delicacy that the rest of us couldn't
<br>afford."
<p>So, she's been writing a play. At night, she hunches in the safe-house,
<br>scribbling pages of speeches. I've read a couple. One part Seneca,
one part
<br>Moliere, not as great as others, but just might get an audience.
<p>After the camera, we meet Mitzi again. First, what events brought us
to her.
<br>Marie found out a rack of costumes was left behind in some storm or
air raid or
<br>something. Fabric is dear, as is anything to help disguise people.
Louise scouts
<br>by sweet-talking the gendermerie and Tim scouts by wandering around
and drawing.
<br>They warn us of daily round-ups happening in the area. Yes, kids, we'll
be
<br>careful. Tatiana was occupied with tending box gardens, otherwise,
she'd love to
<br>go.
<p>Marie and I get off at the Metro stop, plain and gray as possible, my
hat in a
<br>cap and hers in a kerchief. It's a chilly, gray November afternoon,
which means
<br>no air raids.
<p>I turn to her and whisper, "How are we not going to get stopped?"
<p>"Not enough faith in our old rags?"
<p>"I don't know . . ."
<p>Then I see her leap to a window gate. She's trying to get a good grip,
edging to
<br>a clothing line. I climb up to join her.
<p>"What are you doing," I say.
<p>"If we're not on the street, they won't see us."
<p>"A person climbing will get noticed.
<p>"Not if I tell them I am practicing for busking."
<p>"And what if you fall?"
<p>"Before I met your brother, before I was a Clown de la Mort, the city
was my
<br>stage and I performed without a net."
<p>"You're not performing. That requires people who want to see you. You're
showing
<br>off."
<p>"You sound like your brother."
<p>"Well, he'll kill me if you crack your head."
<p>"Do you trust I won't?"
<p>I decide that sooner or later, someone will wonder why I was hanging
off the
<br>gate, while Marie had a better excuse. I climb down, and then walk
like I was
<br>just a visitor. Marie walks the clothing line like she's back at the
cabaret.
<p>Indeed, there is a rack of clothing, much of it period costume. Whatever
people
<br>couldn't fit in, we can use for alterations. We plan to take them to
the safe
<br>house, and then Marie jerks her head. "I hear footsteps."
<p>"Me too."
<p>We maneuver the rack against the wall and lean into it.
<p>There are certain sentences you don't want to hear. One of them is "We
are
<br>looking for Daniel and Richard Elfman."
<p>Oh fuck. I remember when war was declared; Richard and I would argue
with
<br>bureaucrats that we weren't part of a fifth column, and that we're
naturalized
<br>because there was nothing for us in Germany. Now that France is over-run,
we are
<br>considered a threat simply for not being dead.
<p>"Marie, Marie," I whisper. "We're just going to go in the direction
of the
<br>safe-house. If they spot us, we're running.”
<p>We wheel the rack toward the safe house, and then we see the little
old lady who
<br>owns the place on the stairs. Not just on the stairs, but being lead
away by the
<br>gendarmerie in her little dull rose housecoat and kerchief. Fuck, can't
we find
<br>any place in Paris anymore?
<p>Marie turns to me to whisper, "I know a place, if we keep going. Just
follow my
<br>directions. Street's a little steep, though."
<p>"Fine," I mutter, "just get us out of their view."
<p>We walk at a brisk pace, with Marie telling me to go left, go another
left, now
<br>straight, and look for the third apartment on my right. All the while,
I hope
<br>for no gendarmes.
<p>"We're almost there," she says. Then I feel the rack lurch away from
me. This
<br>must be the steep part. I hold the bars of the rack, walking slowly
and pulling
<br>against the bars, as Marie steadies the front of the rack.
<p>We come to the apartment, the same gray stone and blackened windows
as everyone
<br>else. Marie knocks and the door opens. The voice that comes out is
lilting,
<br>female, in French, but a faint accent from somewhere else. "Quite a
cart, Marie.
<br>Is Tanya in need of material?"
<p>Only a few people call Tatiana 'Tanya,' that short Russian nickname.
<p>We wheel the cart in, walking into a bare living room with a red chair,
an old
<br>brown piano and rust-stained white walls. Then I hear it. "It's you,
the little
<br>man with the big sneer."
<p>I turn to the direction of that voice. Tall, long straight dark brown
hair,
<br>great legs, and a hint of a smirk on her face. Not her. "Oh, hello,
Mitzi."
<p>"Danny, my name is Miriam, not Mitzi."
<p>Miriam 'Mitzi' Cutler is a clown who ran away from the circus, if you
please.
<br>She was a woman of many talents: great singer, superb trumpet player,
good at
<br>clarinet and saxophone, a musician rather than just a performer and
works well
<br>with the other musicians. She wanted more. She composes her works,
and wanted to
<br>perform those. Wonderful, but I started this whole mess; I'm the one
that
<br>composes the music there. After one too many fights about that, she
up and left.
<br>I think that was when I was dating Karl.
<p>Of course, among her talents is sparkling wit and etc. She still has
friends
<br>among the Clowns. Stefan Bartek still talks to her, Helene Cartier
still talks
<br>to her, and guess what, so does Marie-Pascale Dufour Elfman.
<p>She is polite throughout our visit, helping us move the rack in a clear
space,
<br>then giving us linden tea. "That was all I could get at the market."
<p>Fortunately for her, she could get enough at the market. From what I
got from
<br>her conversation with Marie, she's scoring film now, commuting from
Paris to
<br>Bolounge to work on period costume dramas. She talks about getting
up early to
<br>catch infrequent trains, long hours with the orchestra, and fast changes
in
<br>personnel. In between the words, I could catch references to Propagandastaffel
<br>demands; the firing of Jews and Communists; the disappearances of those
caught
<br>making anti-German remarks, the screams, the absences, and the attempts
to make
<br>a statement when a statement could kill you. In her way, she is resisting.
I can
<br>admire her from a nice, polite distance.
<p>Somewhere in the middle, Marie sips her tea and turns to me. "Daniel,
I think I
<br>ought to invite her to dinner, since she was kind enough to invite
into her
<br>home. What do you think?"
<p>"Why do I have a feeling that you do not particularly care what I think?"
<p>"Perhaps because you know any good to come of her visit outweighs your
own
<br>feelings about her." Of course, I could see Marie's logic. Not only
was Miriam a
<br>friend, someone familiar with us, but a French citizen, someone with
a good
<br>alibi, a means of travel into the Unoccupied Zone, and an unassuming
appearance.
<p>So why the hell do I not want her around? The cabaret is in the past
anyway, and
<br>will stay in the past until the Nazis leave.
<p>"Sure. Seven in the evening, next Tuesday. I'll see you there . . .Miriam."
<p>Her head tilts incredulous. This is make for interesting night next
Tuesday.
<p>"If God was just
<br>And fate was kind,
<br>You'd be in your yellow dress
<br>Between love and disgust."
<p>Christine recites this in that mix of city and country patois, then
a swish of a
<br>knife across rabbit throat reverberates through the kitchen. I'm just
playing
<br>hearts with Bartek, Avila and Vatos. Tim and Louise are playing with
Louis and a
<br>rabbit. Johann, Helene and Alla are talking with four new people.
<p>Monseiur Massion is the gentleman who brought the chestnuts we're snacking
on.
<br>Who says Englishmen have no manners?
<p>Alla brings Jules, though he is not a Trotskyite. I think she called
him a
<br>Bundist. Like I can keep track. All I know is that he's a mechanic
who can find
<br>hiding place for refugees. He's tall and thin, with a dark, thick beard
and
<br>tired, dark eyes.
<p>His sister Naomi-Chaiya left Lithuania, traveling by foot and smuggled
in a
<br>crate. Strikes me as jumping out of the pot into the fire, but Jules
is her
<br>brother, the closest she has to family now. She is shorter than Jules,
but just
<br>as thin, with big brown eyes, cropped dark brown hair and a narrow
face. She is
<br>pretty, possibly beautiful in better times.
<p>We all know Miriam, of course.
<p>"I'm just an ignorant country maid,
<br>Not laden with gifts like the Magi,
<br>Not clean like your sheets,
<br>Not stable like Deutschmarks made."
<p>So here we all are, in a boarding house Massion swears is safe. No informants
<br>and no bugs. We're all relaxed. Richard is preparing vegetables for
cooking,
<br>Marie is directing people, Tatiana is setting the table, and Christine
is the
<br>butcher tonight. The conversations are still in murmurs, except perhaps
for
<br>Christine. Occasionally, I see through the door Marie leaning against
Richard,
<br>kissing his forehead before giving another order.
<p>Richard stops chopping to call out to Christine, "Perhaps you should
stay away
<br>from prostitutes. A good idea not for your heart, but for your neck."
<p>"But perhaps. However, women who turn tricks and women who perform understanding
<br>lying for a living."
<p>"So, why are you surprised when they lie about everything else?"
<p>Christine sighs and continues.
<p>"You told me, 'The Wehrmacht was just business,'
<br>I believed that lie.
<br>I only offered you my hands and my breasts,
<br>Only my cunt and my heart."
<p>Another swish reverberates through the kitchen after Christine says
heart.
<br>Louise whimpers and clutches a small, gray rabbit with drooping ears
on her lap.
<br>The rabbit is indifferent to the sounds of his siblings' slaughter.
He continues
<br>to sit still and twitch his nose.
<p>"Good Grisett, good boy."
<p>"He's lucky he's the runt and she was willing to give it to you for
nothing."
<p>"He's not a runt, he's beautiful."
<p>"You don't know the first thing about taking care of a rabbit."
<p>"I know to keep him warm and dry."
<p>"Well then, you have a hutch?"
<p>"Do you know where I can find one?"
<p>Jules then turns from the conversation. "Listen, my French is so good
. . .you
<br>said you need a hutch, right, for rabbits?"
<p>Louise nods.
<p>"Perhaps I can make one."
<p>"If there is wood," Bartek mutters.
<p>Christine goes back to cutting rabbits.
<p>I spend the quiet night trying to shoot the moon. We argue, we cajole
and debate
<br>in murmurs. It's been weeks, maybe months since we had a full dinner,
rather
<br>than small meals on the run. Everyone brought something. I spent weeks
of
<br>busking money on coffee and coals for cooking. God I miss black coffee.
I better
<br>not rush through dinner just for the coffee. I won't have another one
in God
<br>knows when.
<p>Johann turns to me from his seat and says, "Malina is okay."
<p>"I couldn't hear," I reply.
<p>"Sirvart had to hide in the powder room, but Malina is alive and getting
on the
<br>southern route with Lourdes."
<p>"Thank heavens," I mumble and go back to my game.
<p>Louis stares bewildered at all these people, babbling. Tim hoists Louis
in his
<br>arms and talks in Tatiana's direction. "Just move your wrists, you
know, in a
<br>circle. Keeps your hands from being cramped."
<p>A pause, then Tatiana calls back, "Well, imagine, it does work."
<p>"Yeah, Tatiana, I learned how to do that in school."
<p>Johann's conversation with Naomi floats through the room. Vaguely German,
but
<br>not really, but still familiar.
<p>"Naomi, you sound just like my grandfather," I say in German. Jules
and Naomi
<br>look at me confused and disturbed. Johann sighs and murmurs something
in that
<br>ambiguous language.
<p>He then turns to me. "They don't quite understand, they aren't speaking
German .
<br>. ."
<p>"Actually, my grandfather is from the Ukraine. He spoke German, but
every once
<br>in a while, he would slip into this language I never really understood,
that
<br>sound like German, yet wasn't."
<p>"I was speaking Yiddish, Daniel. I know some from my patients. They
know
<br>French," Johann says, pausing to rub his eyes, "but feel comfortable
with this."
<p>I never learned what my grandfather would say, and my parents never
really
<br>pushed me to. In fact, they didn't like to talk about the past. As
far as they
<br>were concerned, they left that behind in various Russian villages,
crushed by
<br>Cossack hooves. I never knew what stories my grandfather had. Seeing
Jules and
<br>Naomi is like seeing my parents, younger, frightened, slowly getting
used to
<br>another country and another language.
<p>We're both in the same fucking boat.
<p>I turn my attention to the rest of the sitting room. Tim is now teaching
Louis
<br>how to pet Grisett, his long fingers guiding Louis' small hands. Vatos
speaks in
<br>code about derailing a supply train, with Avila offering suggestions
and Bartek
<br>glancing at Avila nervously.
<p>Miriam is telling Helene about staying in Bolounge, spending days with
the
<br>orchestra, dodging the producers' advances, and being brought in to
change bars
<br>that sound suspiciously close to subversive compositions.
<p>"I'm tired, really tired," she whispers, rubbing her head. "I haven't
talked
<br>this freely in years. I don't want to compose for films anymore, not
until
<br>something changes. It gets harder to work in decent films, never mind
decent
<br>French films. I have no idea what else to do. When I can, I get together
with
<br>some people, find out things . . ."
<p>Helene nods. "We can always use that, if that is what you want."
<p>Miriam nods, and I swear, glances at me, wary. "Yes, yes I think so."
<p>A few games of hearts, some punning games and a sunset later, we are
called to
<br>dinner. Louis is placed in a high chair, perhaps left behind by one
tenant or
<br>another. We move tables and light candles in the sitting room, and
then take a
<br>seat. After all, the current won't be turned on until eleven at night,
at least.
<p>First course is broscht, made by Alla in some other safe house.
<p>"Grandfather used to make this whenever we'd visit," Richard remarks.
<p>Avila wonders, "If we're going to have cold soup, why not gazpacho?"
<p>"Tomatoes are out of season," answers Alla.
<p>"Oh, right."
<p>Tatiana, Jules and Naomi take spoonfuls, while the rest of the table
sips,
<br>unfamiliar with the idea of beets as a soup. Alla looks around and
shrugs. "It's
<br>really better with sour cream."
<p>"Not possible," Richard answers, "the Germans confiscated the cows."
Silence,
<br>like we're waiting for the gendarmes to charge. Then we start the nervous
<br>giggles.
<p>Second course was as much black bread as can be given to each of us.
Turns out
<br>to have more Loire Valley barley than sawdust. Very good. Richard pulls
out two
<br>bottles of sparkling white wine, and gives us each some, even if it
amounts to a
<br>thimble.
<p>I take a sip. It's dry, light, with summer fruit undertones. "Where
did you get
<br>this? Wine is impossible to get these days."
<p>"Leon gave it to me when Louis was born. I was saving it for a special
<br>occasion."
<p>Faces fall, people stop chewing on their bread. Jules and Naomi look
confused.
<br>Naomi whispers, "Leon?"
<p>"He played horns with us, before the Occupation," Richard says. "He
was taken
<br>away . . ."
<p>"He would make new instruments out of broken ones. Somewhere, there
is something
<br>he called a rumbaphone, that we would sometimes put in songs," I add.
<p>"He was my friend," Miriam says.
<p>Naomi's eyes grow wide. "Nazis?"
<p>"Here it isn't the Nazis that take away Jews, it is the gendarmerie,
the
<br>police."
<p>"The ghetto police did take away people in Vilna, but I didn't think
they did it
<br>here . . ."
<p>Johann shakes his head. "No, no, they're French."
<p>"Yehuda," Naomi says, "I can't tell whether Paris is better or worse
than
<br>Vilna."
<p>Jules shrugs, "The French will turn you in, but they won't shoot you."
He sips
<br>his wine. "Besides, more people will hide you."
<p>"But not by much," Richard mutters.
<p>We talk about the old days in the cabaret while nibbling on cabbage.
We remember
<br>songs we did, skits we wrote, people we pissed off, hair we set on
fire. The
<br>time Christine dated that singer Edith whats-her-name, the time Kurt
Weill came
<br>in for a show and told us "No one here understands German. I don't
even want to
<br>hear German. And less horns."
<p>"Then Miriam left and Avila came in. She left because of . . . differences
in
<br>approach," Richard says.
<p>Miriam's reply is quick. "I left because your brother wouldn't take
my ideas
<br>seriously. He also wanted me to wear a black silk corset and leather
boots."
<p>Why this came out of my mouth, I don't know. "It would have made a visual
<br>impact, you fucking prude."
<p>"So you wear it. Not to mention you would talk about the most gruesome
subjects.
<br>Corpses and vampires and prostitutes . . ."
<p>"I wrote the lyrics about prostitutes," Christine states indigently.
<p>"Why anyone would admit that, I don't know. I like music to make people
laugh,
<br>think, and dance. I thought a lot of what you wrote was really good,
but much
<br>too dark . . ."
<p>"Miriam, what I wrote in those days were fucking nursery rhymes compared
to
<br>what's happening outside."
<p>"Are you two going to argue throughout dinner," Richard butts in, "because
I am
<br>really curious about which one of you will pull the pigtails and run."
<p>"Oh, do not start with me. Bad enough about the bondage gear, but topless?
I am
<br>not playing in Moulin Rouge, thank you."
<p>"Topless was a bad choice." Richard takes another sip of wine. "You
had better
<br>legs than tits, anyway."
<p>"I don't care what you think of her legs. You can look, but you can't
touch,"
<br>Marie interjects.
<p>"Was that it? I was a pair of legs to you two, not someone with some
ambitions?
<br>God, I always thought you didn't like women that much, but really .
. ."
<p>Marie mumbles something about Miriam acting like a vache, but I wasn't
going to
<br>let it rest. I guess I should be glad she stabs in the front rather
than the
<br>back. "If it is about your compositions, I didn't perform them because
Les
<br>Clowns de la Mort was my idea, something under my control. As a matter
of fact,
<br>I thought, still think, that you're very talented. If you started your
own
<br>group, I would be the first in line to see you. I admire your work.
Your . . .
<br>other traits leave much to be desired."
<p>"Much like your behavior toward your lovers."
<p>"Miriam, please," begs Bartek.
<p>Marie is seething. "Let's talk of something else, now."
<p>"I, we just want to eat in peace," Helene murmurs.
<p>That woman doesn't know when to finish; unfortunately, I don't either.
"Pardon?"
<p>"I can hear you now. 'Tell them I'm busy.' 'Can't--rehearsal.' I'm busy
too, but
<br>I take time to see people, to soak up other people's influences. No
wonder
<br>Andromache and Karl left--"
<p>Richard turns away. I snarl, "And what do you know? Maybe that's why
Andromache
<br>left--she wanted to have a musician for a companion, but didn't realize
that
<br>meant her lover would spend time actually doing work for little money."
<p>"I know the feeling," Johann interrupts, "most women are horrified that
I treat
<br>the 'scum' rather than the wealthy." Helene brushes a lock of his hair
in
<br>sympathy.
<p>Miriam looks less angry. "And Karl?"
<p>"Karl left because . . .propriety." I spit that last word like a curse.
"God
<br>forbid people find out the young doctor was a 'sodomite.' His word,
not mine. It
<br>wasn't love, but I don't want to be told I was something foul and evil
. . ." I
<br>couldn't talk, so I tried to muster some bile. "Why do you care?"
<p>Tim must have heard. He turns in his seat, facing me across the table.
"Daniel,
<br>you're not foul or evil."
<p>Richard smirks, "He's evil in an amusing way, but, yes, didn't know
the story
<br>behind that fellow."
<p>"It's over anyway, Timothee . . ."
<p>A new voice shouts, "Open up!"
<p>The loud shout freezes us in place. Then we hear another voice, "Please,
please,
<br>monseiur, my husband, he isn't here."
<p>I didn't care about Miriam, I focus my anger on Monsieur Massion. "You
told us
<br>this boarding house was safe," I hiss.
<p>He sighs and whisper. "They don't suspect us. We are safe here, I can't
<br>guarantee the other guests."
<p>Richard looks nervous. "You sure?"
<p>Calm down, take stock. "Perhaps we should make plans to get out. It
may be
<br>nothing . . ."
<p>"Oh fuck," Miriam murmurs, "I have pamphlets, about some vegetable shipments
to
<br>Germany. Sometimes I find out about evictions, searches. What government
folks
<br>are taking off the top."
<p>"You're more useful than I thought," Marie snickers. "Have you been
caught?"
<p>"Not yet."
<p>The shouts and the sounds of overturned possessions reverberate, though
muffled.
<br>Richard takes a deep breath. "All right, Johann, Tatiana, Timothee,
Miriam,
<br>Louise, grab the rest of the dishes." Naomi lifts Louis from his high
chair and
<br>holds him. He blinks uncomprehending. Richard continues, "Bartek, do
you know
<br>how to get to the nearest."
<p>He nods, high curly hair bobbing. "Sure, but that is a loose term .
. ."
<p>"We'll take what we can get." I grab my gun from the waist of my pants
and check
<br>how many bullets. Richard checks his gun from his coat, Avila and Vatos
slides
<br>two rifles from under the table, Monsieur Massion flips his coat open
to check
<br>on his, Alla and Jules load their small pistols. Christine slides out
a rifle
<br>from a cabinet. Meanwhile, everyone else gets out winter coats.
<p>Johann turns to me, "Daniel, before we go, I used to try the two of
you from
<br>fighting. Today, I decided to let you have at it. I learned something
new about
<br>you. Miriam doesn't talk much about it, but . . . I want you to consider
that
<br>you have more in common with Miriam than not. Do something that you
don't
<br>usually do."
<p>I think I know what he means. I turn to Miriam and whisper "Truce?"
<p>She nods, looking at the rest of the unarmed group. "You really didn't
deserve
<br>that remark about your lovers. I'm not better at it myself."
<p>I shrug and glance over at Tim holding a pot of coffee. "You'll be safe,
right?"
<p>"I worry more about you." He gives me a soft smile and looks around.
<p>The chaos not far from us still booms: the shouts, the pleas, and the
opening
<br>door. I hold my gun and wonder again about why this is happening. No
one can
<br>stop it, not here, not above. Then again, I never got the impression
that
<br>petitioning worked. My parents mostly prayed thanking that things are
more good
<br>than bad. I wait, ready to spring at a moment's notice, hoping we all
survive
<br>the night.
<p>We hear the curses of a man, the screaming pleas of a woman, footstep,
and then
<br>silence. None of us sit down until all we could hear are faint scratches
of
<br>phonographs, chattering and snoring.
<p>After we sit down, Tatiana serves the carrot and onion mixture. Tim
suddenly
<br>says "He's done the 'go away, I'm busy' thing with me, but then again,
so do I.
<br>We do find time to do something together." Miriam looks at me confused.
<p>I decide to explain. "Oh, he does that, continues conversations you
almost
<br>forgot you had."
<p>Miriam then cranes to see Tim. "You mean, you and Daniel . . ."
<p>"Are going at it like rabid voles," Richard interjects.
<p>I sigh. "It's a little hard to when you're doing something else entirely."
<p>Miriam looks at me, then at Tim. "He's a lot taller than the people
you usually
<br>date. You must be moving away from the Napoleon thing."
<p>"Not in this lifetime," Richard mutters. The rest of the table giggles.
Tim
<br>giggles too, but at least has the grace to look guilty.
<p>The rest of the dinner is uneventful. Over rabbit and mushrooms, we
discuss
<br>street renovations, possible safe houses and recent arrests. Over Comte
cheese
<br>and blackberries, we talk about smuggled American jazz records and
black market
<br>sweets. Over coffee and Swiss chocolate thanks to Louise's grandmother,
we
<br>started on the jokes.
<p>"I remember when the Nazis first marched in," Christine reminisces.
"I had a
<br>friend working coat check at some fancy place. She said that they ate
whole
<br>sticks of butter in one setting. No wonder it's so damn hard to get.
All the
<br>Nazis eating butter like they're pigs back at the farm."
<p>Monsieur Massion cocks his head. "I'm curious, only one man here is
from France,
<br>the rest of you I imagine are from somewhere else."
<p>Richard corrects him, "We had Michel, but well, he's arrested, the ladies
tried
<br>to find out where he was taken, but who the fuck knows where in Alsace
he is . .
<br>."
<p>"Oh God," Miriam mutters.
<p>"Petain sent the brave Frenchman to die in Verdun," Helene quips.
<p>No one really laughs, but it just might be true.
<p>Johann breaks the silence. "The papers for Stockholm, I'm going to try
for
<br>three, but I think I will only be able to get two."
<p>Richard nods. "There still may be hope."
<p>After dinner, the lights come on. We made up games, talk about books
we haven't
<br>read and plays and films we haven't seen. I borrow Avila's guitar and
play
<br>another coded song. Monsieur Massion drinks tea and tries to participate
with
<br>us. I think he is a little scared of us, what after an argument at
dinner and
<br>everything else we say. When the current is turned off, we light candles,
talk
<br>and play cards. Soon, we go to bed.
<p>Before Louis goes to bed, Tatiana tells him a story. She whispers sweet
and low
<br>about a cat with silver earrings owned by a cannibal in the steppes.
She lures
<br>people in by meowing pitifully, leading to them to the cannibal for
his dinner.
<p>I awake with a sharp elbow to my side. I turn to that direction to see
Tim
<br>wide-eyed, tossing back and forth, obviously trying to find a good
position to
<br>sleep in. "Ow, fuck, Tim." He stops and turns to me, surprised that
I am awake.
<p>"I can't sleep."
<p>"Oh."
<p>"Jesus, Daniel," he whispers, "you're right next to me and I want to,
you know,
<br>but if we do, we'll wake up people, or maybe I'll wake up people by
my
<br>babbling." He lowers his head.
<p>Fortunately, no one wakes up from Tim's outburst. I put my hand on his
shoulder,
<br>bringing him close to me. His chin is over my mouth, so I move up so
I am
<br>ear-level. "Maybe I can help you sleep by telling you a story," I say.
<p>He then lays still and squints. "Huh?" He then places his hand on my
back.
<p>"Trust me," I whisper in a slow, husky and untrustworthy voice. I pause,
<br>brushing my lips to his ear. "So there you are, sketching something
or other."
<p>"I do other things beside sketching, you know," he interrupts.
<p>"Well, you do a lot of it, I mean, when you have time."
<p>"Maybe I could earn money from it. Disney sounds good. I think I'll
work for
<br>them. You ever been to America?"
<p>"No, I might want to. I want to go to Senegal first, though. Maybe other
places
<br>in West Africa, maybe Indonesia." I stop to run my fingers through
<br>always-tangled hair, and then trail down to his cheek. His cheeks are
round in
<br>contrast to his long face, but rough with stubble. "I want to tell
you the rest
<br>of the story."
<p>He nods, nuzzling. "So you're not noticing me walking. I brush against
that mop
<br>of hair to see if you notice, but you're so absorbed. I decide to continue,
<br>kneeling over to nibble on your ear." Then I decide to do so, making
him purr.
<p>He stops long enough to murmur, "And I keep on drawing."
<p>I stop nibbling to look at him. "You're a brat."
<p>"I know."
<p>"So, I'm not going to stop." I go back to nibbling his ear. I decide
to whisper
<br>"There's something enthralling about the way you immerse yourself in
your
<br>drawing. So much focus, so much passion. It reminds me of how much
attention you
<br>give to me, how you use your hands and mouth like you use your pen
and pencil."
<p>He murmurs assent and kisses my chin. "You do, too, you know, you look
so
<br>peaceful when you're playing music. Go on."
<p>"I suppose if you're going to keep on drawing, you won't pay attention
to me
<br>doing this." I lick the earlobe, then lick the ridge. I move my mouth
back down
<br>to the earlobe, then down his jaw line, then to his neck. My lips just
brush
<br>against the skin, just enough to feel his pulse quicken.
<p>Then I scrape with my teeth. He gasps and covers his mouth. "Oh! Oh,
I guess I'm
<br>not drawing anymore."
<p>I sooth the skin with the tip of my tongue, which makes him sigh. "My
hands lean
<br>on your shoulders, while I move closer. Then I brush down your chest,
stopping .
<br>. ."
<p>Then I hear something other than his breathing. I could hear the smack
of limbs
<br>against the hard floor and broken shouts. I could hear, "Nein, nein,
alles tod."
<p>All dead. Then I hear a shout, making me bolt up and away from Tim.
<p>I wasn't the only one. Marie was up, as is Jules. Naomi bolts up, panting
and
<br>sweating.
<p>"Naomi," Marie whispers, "are you all right?"
<p>She nods. "I'm well. I had, how do you say it, a nightmare. Yes. Just
a
<br>nightmare."
<p>Jules looks at Naomi concerned. "I'm here, you know, there's nothing
to worry
<br>about," he whispers.
<p>Naomi nods. "Yehuda, do not worry about me. I will get sleep. I will
be able to
<br>do . . ."
<p>"We understand." Marie says, nodding. She takes a small pillow from
under her
<br>and gives it to Naomi. "Perhaps this will help you sleep more comfortably."
<p>"Thank you, Madame." She holds the pillow like a doll and lies down.
Jules nods
<br>and lies down too. Before going to sleep, Marie checks in Louis' cradle,
perhaps
<br>too small for him, but Richard was worried about someone crushing him.
After
<br>that, she lies down too.
<p>When I lie down, Tim whispers, "Did you understand enough of what the
girl
<br>said?"
<p>I nod. "Enough to worry me."
<p>He smiles slight and coy. "Let me finish the rest of the story."
<p>I squint, wondering if he could. "Of course. I don't mind."
<p>"I grab your hands just as your fingers are, you know, where they are.
I pull
<br>you down for a long kiss, pulling you toward the bed." Now when he
whispers,
<br>some people think 'head-cold.' However, I'm thinking 'sex.' Especially
when it
<br>gets lower and he catches his breath more.
<p>"My hands move all over you, you know, getting at places I don't always
touch.
<br>The small of your back, the nape of your neck, the part where your
hip and your
<br>waist meet, tracing outlines of your muscles, making me think of how
I had to
<br>trace Grey's Anatomy for days to get figure drawing right, and how
I finally got
<br>it when I drew you."
<p>He sighs. "Sorry. I think you try to claw at my back, but I keep on
feeling you,
<br>your collarbone, your stomach cleft, your inner thigh. I don't go for
the places
<br>you want, I move my leg between your leg and my leg between your leg.
Like
<br>scissors. I play with your hair, kiss more, kiss hard, rub, feel you
so warm, so
<br>hard, so shocked, so beautiful, so lean, so pale, so red, so hazel,
so you."
<p>I think I was breathing hard as he tells me this. I debate grabbing
him; I
<br>debate taking the baton. I decide my companions would much rather I
whisper than
<br>moan, so I do so. "I don't claw at your back, not really. I try to
unbutton your
<br>shirt as you buck against me. My fingers trace patterns on the bare
chest. Your
<br>wanting . . . well, I move against you in kind, my head leaning against
your
<br>chest when I . . ."
<p>"Like I imagine I did?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>We kiss and go to sleep.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>An officer in the ghetto police force met with Rabbi Asimov discreetly.
It was
<br>simple: he was actually a member of Betar, he is assigned to escort
the rabbi,
<br>his wife and Nehemiah to 'relocation.'
<p>"What was our crime?" Rabbi Asimov said off-handed.
<p>The officer sighs, "The same as all of us. Living."
<p>He has contacts, he said. He can get false papers for all of them, can
get
<br>forest guides from the partisans. All he has to do is make the rounds,
<br>pretending to escort them to the gates, and slip them out.
<p>"Are they reliable?"
<p>"I don't know if any of you have a choice."
<p>Rabbi Asimov sighed. "I know of the sewers. Naomi . . ."
<p>"That will be the fall-back plan. Too many people have gotten lost in
there to
<br>be the only plan." The officer bows his head. "If I am not there, the
waterworks
<br>can guide you."
<p>Nehemiah and Shifra were escorted by another Betar member, out of the
ghetto and
<br>into other hiding places. By nightfall, Rabbi Asimov was alone. Hunched
over his
<br>desk with one candle, he writes an apology.
<p>He once thought the round-ups were punishment, punishment for the young
people
<br>turning to politics and not to study, for the citizens of Vilna for
not being
<br>more observant. Maybe it was he that needed to be more observant, not
only of
<br>halacha, but also of the people around him.
<p>If this is punishment, why isn't he the first to die? Why is it the
most
<br>dedicated the teachers, the pious, who were the first to be 'resettled?'
He was
<br>just an old man teetering on being declared 'apikouros.' What of Naomi-Chaiya?
<br>She observes the rituals, why was she taken to Ponar?
<p>"Perhaps this is punishment. Perhaps this is a test. Perhaps I should
have
<br>talked to the young people, who put their hopes in a homeland or a
classless
<br>society because old scholars like me were too busy to offer them more.
Too busy
<br>with what? Arguing with myself about the nature of the universe? Of
the madness
<br>of the age? Through it all, I have only one answer: it is we who must
save each
<br>other."
<p>He hid the writings in a niche. Before the ghetto police force came,
he left
<br>through the back door, feeling that he had said everything.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>November slides into December and the days grow darker. We hear news
of
<br>victories in North Africa and in Russia. We hear news that the Nazis
are
<br>marching south, toward the Unoccupied Zone. I guess no more paths to
Marseilles.
<br>We managed to save some people from round-ups in Paris, but not all,
not all the
<br>time.
<p>I am alone, shivering and ducking in corners after busking. Johann tells
me that
<br>he was able to secure two sets of papers. One set of papers for Louis
and the
<br>other for one of the parents. One will stay, and face who knows what.
<p>The room Richard and Marie stay in is drafty and dusty, one thin wool
blanket
<br>for bedding and a knapsack for a pillow. Louis sleeps beside his parents
in a
<br>vegetable crate with his coat on.
<p>They still have their day clothes on, long skirt and long pants, boots
and
<br>socks, button shirts and thick sweaters. Richard is wearing a long
coat that is
<br>too big for him, but big enough to snuggle Marie inside. His arm is
around her.
<br>They aren't sleeping.
<p>"Only two tickets," Marie whispers.
<p>"One for Louis, one for either of us," Richard replies. "That's what
Johann
<br>says."
<p>"We wait any longer to see if all of us can get out, none of us will
get out."
<p>"Especially with the South being invaded."
<p>"Not like it was any easier with the folks in Vichy."
<p>Richard sighs. "Starving by your countrymen or by my countrymen is no
choice at
<br>all." He pauses to brush a lock of hair away from her face. "I think
you should
<br>go. My parents might be surprised by your visit. They've only seen
you in a
<br>photograph I sent them. They'll like you, however." He wipes his eyes.
"I'm
<br>strong. I can keep myself out of trouble, just stay behind with the
radio and an
<br>occasional tour."
<p>Marie is silent, tracing patterns on his chest. He is startled when
she finally
<br>whispers, "No, you go."
<p>"Marie--"
<p>"It's simple. I get captured, I go to jail, maybe get some small things
slipped
<br>to me by some soft hearted fellow, get out when the Allies come. Even
they
<br>don't, someone may pardon me for good behavior. If you get captured,
you die.
<br>You know what Danny and Johann--"
<p>"Louis cannot grow up without a mother."
<p>"You want him to live without a father?"
<p>He is silent in the face of this, something he knew but never truly
connected to
<br>his own small family. He cups her chin in his hand.
<p>She smirks. "You're not going to be chasing those Stockholm women, are
you?"
<p>"I'll come home. It never crossed my mind, really." She tilts her head
to his
<br>shoulder, confused. "They are not like you."
<p>"You're not joking?"
<p>"Well, you're small and dark like most girls coming to Paris to seek
fame,
<br>fortune and all those other clich&eacute;s. Good cheekbones, good legs.
That wasn't
<br>what really drew me to you."
<p>He closes his eyes, thinking of the words. "Nothing startled you. You
took
<br>sunshine and showers, ecstatic crowds and mobs of hecklers, good times
and bad
<br>as a given. You appreciated the good and shrugged at the bad." He sighs,
<br>realizing he is starting to get a lump in his throat, starting to tell
her what
<br>he needs to. "I needed it. You don't know how broken I felt in Berlin.
I was no
<br>longer anything; not a student, not a law clerk, not a lover."
<p>"You had a girl in Berlin?"
<p>"She and I drifted, I suppose. If it weren't for Daniel, for the cabaret,
for
<br>you and Louis, I would not even be here. Pardon, I am not this sentimental."
<p>Marie takes his hand and holds it against her chin. "I'm listening."
<p>"The day after I was dismissed from law school, you know, the proctor
being too
<br>enthusiastic about the new laws, I came down to the Rhine. I never
thought about
<br>the river much. I certainly never thought about throwing myself in
before. Here
<br>I was, though, thinking if I just jumped in, I could stop this feeling
of
<br>everything I thought would make for a good life disappearing. I thought
about
<br>how I wasted my life in dusty classrooms while I hummed arias in my
head. That I
<br>abandoned everything I really cared for, and just cannot get it back.
I thought
<br>I could just have nights out to the theater and phonographs and prints
in my
<br>house."
<p>He kisses her nose. "A thought cut through the pain: what about Daniel?
When he
<br>was kicked out of school, he took his suitcase and violin, left and
never looked
<br>back. I thought it was mad then . . ."
<p>"He did the right thing, then. These are mad times."
<p>"I know that now." He kisses her forehead. "After all that, I won't
forget you.
<br>You've calmed me down, you've fed the lunatics who perform with us,
you've
<br>listened to me rant as a besieged stage director. I don't think I can
give you
<br>half as much as you've given me."
<p>"You being there is enough."
<p>"The fact that I can make you cry out with my touch doesn't count at
all?"
<p>This is when Marie tickles Richard. Giggling, he overpowers Marie, holding
her
<br>wrist against the floor. He grins and covers her face with kisses.
She kisses
<br>his mouth, nipping his lip and flicking her tongue against his.
<p>Their fingers trace against each others' form covered by clothing as
they deepen
<br>the kiss. Richard then breaks away, saying "After four years and one
son, I
<br>still want to grab you and do things that would horrify my brother
if I told
<br>him."
<p>Chuckling, she raises her leg, lifting her long skirt a touch. Richard
pulls his
<br>arms from his coat, and wraps the coat around the two of them.
<p>His hands are around her and between her, exploring under her skirt
with his
<br>fingers. She lays her head against his shoulder to keep the noise down,
all the
<br>while touching in kind.
<p>"You're bare-bottomed," he says confused.
<p>"I haven't done any wash."
<p>"Oh." He continues touching more and deeper.
<p>She stops her teasing and unbuttons her husband's pants. After more
touches, she
<br>guides him inside. Pulling the coat tighter, they move together, quiet
and fast.
<br>She pulls him closer as he collapses from his little death.
<p>His last words before he sleeps are "I love you. I'll miss you."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Helene gets a woman from the rations line to bring Louis and Richard
to the
<br>train station. With Johann passing false papers and tickets for the
train and
<br>ferry, we plan to get them to a safe place before leaving.
<p>The days leading to departure time, I am frantic to be nowhere near
Richard. If
<br>I am not busking in places no one recognized me, I am getting Christine
and
<br>Louise messages and explosives to deliver, I am waiting in dark places,
guarding
<br>make-shift explosive labs, holding my gun tight.
<p>I appoint Timothee the new BBC listener, due to his still strong but
willfully
<br>unused English skills. Marie is still typing pamphlets, and Miriam
is even
<br>helping out.
<p>Richard just won't be there.
<p>The night before he leaves, I am brewing a pot of tea for Naomi and
me. We are
<br>awake when we should be asleep. Somehow, the conversation drifts to
nightmares.
<p>"I don't like to think about the forest. I can't stop dreaming about
it. Jules,
<br>Jules tries to help," she says in halting but good French.
<p>I nod, understanding. "I had nightmares for years. After I woke up,
if I was
<br>home from school, Mama would brew tea for me. Helped me sleep."
<p>I spoon tea leaves into cups, thinking of the people who know of my
imprisonment
<br>in the school cellar. Most of them nod with the sympathy of the untroubled.
Tim,
<br>with his tangled night horrors, alone understands. Maybe this bird-like
girl
<br>with big eyes did too.
<p>"Tell me yours if I tell you mine?"
<p>"Why not, you will see what I have seen."
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>"The Nazis, they took us out of my city, took us into the forest, made
us naked,
<br>made us fall into a pit. They shot us."
<p>"How did you survive?"
<p>"Maybe someone missed me. I got shot, though. I felt pain in my arm,
but I was
<br>feeling. Night came and I climbed."
<p>"What was it like?" Nice going, Elfman. Now you sound like a ghoul.
<p>"I climbed, I remember I pushed my father, my father's body, out of
my way to
<br>get up. I could see the people I was stepping on. I said hello to the
people I
<br>was stepping on. People . . .once lived. Now I am climbing on them,
like they
<br>are rocks."
<p>"That's your nightmare?"
<p>"No. In my nightmare, the bodies just keep piling, and I slip and fall
under
<br>them. I am buried under them, and I can never climb out."
<p>"I can tell you this. You're alive. I am too. That dream is a lie as
long as
<br>someone is alive."
<p>She nods and I sigh. After blowing out the fire and pouring the water,
I talk.
<br>"You make my dream sound ridiculous."
<p>"Tell me," she says, taking her cup slowly.
<p>"I dream I'm nine years old again and locked in a cellar, starving close
to
<br>death."
<p>"Who would do that?"
<p>"My French teacher."
<p>"He couldn't box your ears?"
<p>I giggle. She grins faint but sure. "I would never treat you like that,
even you
<br>were a bad boy. A very bad boy."
<p>"Well, I would never shoot you."
<p>We drink our tea and sleep in cots. I fall asleep, happy for some understanding.
<p>Chaos comes in with dawn. Miriam looks out for anyone we don't know,
while Marie
<br>folds clothes into suitcases for Richard and Louis. I am dressing Louis
in
<br>winter clothes while Richard is dressing as fast as he can. After Marie
packs
<br>the suitcases, she grabs handkerchief and wipes Louis' face. If the
gendarmerie
<br>grabs them, they will be impressed by Louis' shining ruddy countenance.
<p>Right. No need to be cruel. This is her way of setting things right.
Now she is
<br>combing Louis' unruly red hair, and the fight to make it perfectly
straight is a
<br>losing one, to judge by Louis' whimpers and Marie's mutterings.
<p>Richard sighs and hoists Louis into his arms. "No need, we'll be fine."
Marie
<br>and Richard kiss goodbye, then she fixes Louis' collar and tells him
to be good.
<br>Louis looks confused. Maybe he doesn't know that he won't see his mother
for a
<br>long time.
<p>Now we are all off.
<p>Why does Richard want me on the cart? Miriam I can understand. Whatever
problems
<br>they had, she does know her way outside of Paris. Me? I have nothing
to help
<br>them with.
<p>I am there, though, hiding behind the two coffins on a cart. Richard
and Louis
<br>are there, unafraid of dark, enclosed places. I envy them that. I am
crouching
<br>between the two coffins and ends of the cart. Perhaps a car is more
comfortable.
<br>However, with petrol being so scarce and so desired by the Hitlerites
that cars
<br>are now banned, this will do.
<p>The woman we are meeting is tall, honey-haired and holding the reins
of a
<br>horse-drawn cart.
<p>"He can go somewhere else. Some place where he is not an outsider."
<p>Miriam squints. "Where?"
<p>"Palestine."
<p>Oh no, a Zionist. I once heard an old joke that when people say, "Jews,
get
<br>out," they are the ones selling the tickets. I hold back the urge to
tell the
<br>joke to her. Miriam can argue for the both of us. Of course, I could
argue for
<br>Miriam and me.
<p>"What’s there? It’s a British mandate, I know, but the quotas must be
enough of
<br>a nightmare."
<p>"It was where we came from. Someplace to stay." Her lips are pursed,
like she is
<br>holding in the urge to make a grand speech that would distract her
from
<br>directing the horse.
<p>"Come on, before the Nazis came, you could go anywhere you want, work
where you
<br>want, study what you want . . ."
<p>"And after the Nazis leave? Madame, I worked as a mannequin before I
drove horse
<br>carts. You want to hear the things the girls said to me behind my back?
My
<br>father was in Verdun, and those delicate flowers still did not consider
me
<br>French. The informers who turned my parents did not consider us French.
The
<br>police who chase us don't consider us French."
<p>"So, you're going to be nothing?"
<p>"No, I'm going to be Jewish and live somewhere where that is as natural
as a
<br>Frenchman in France."
<p>"I'm staying," I mutter. Maybe this was not the best time to join.
<p>"Why? Do you consider Paris your Jerusalem?"
<p>Now she's in for it. "I don't have a Jerusalem. I don't have some perfect
<br>somewhere. I much rather be here and annoy people, maybe change them.
It might
<br>be too much to hope for, but then again, so is just trotting off to
the desert
<br>for some mythical homeland."
<p>"I know it will take work." The woman bows her head, suppressing an
urge for a
<br>grand speech. Still later, they talk again.
<p>Sometimes I listen to the woman driving and Miriam run around like dogs
on the
<br>topic of a Jewish homeland. I am pretty sure the Red Indians get mentioned,
<br>since Miriam is an American with French citizenship and the woman really
wanted
<br>to know how she felt being a descendant of people who weren't originally
from
<br>there.
<p>"Say if a Red Indian wanted to go back to your town . . ."
<p>"Well, he couldn't set up where he was in my house."
<p>"Or even in your town? Is your attitude toward the Red Indian the same
as the
<br>Jew?"
<p>"No, no, it is not. But he cannot live exactly as he once did. There
are
<br>automobiles and post offices and cigarettes . . ."
<p>Miriam sighs and turns in the direction of the coffins. "Richard, what
do you
<br>think?"
<p>Richard says through the coffin, "Dead men do not argue politics."
<p>Sometimes I ignore them and make sure Richard and Louis are safe and
look at the
<br>landscape. Look, bare tree. Hey, evergreen.
<p>"My boyfriend, he's from Algeria, he says that the Algerian Muslims
make great
<br>neighbors, but make bad government, and the French make bad neighbors
but good
<br>government. I'm tired of depending on someone else's government." She
shakes the
<br>reins. "Especially when they start rounding up people whose ancestors
fought for
<br>Napoleon. Compared to that, all the hard labour in the desert everyone
has been
<br>talking about is a little thing."
<p>"What?" Miriam looks at her confused.
<p>"A month ago, they rounded up my father. And who knows what happened
to the rest
<br>of my family in Marseilles?"
<p>"Oh no. We heard about that." We have not, however, met anyone with
relatives
<br>there.
<p>Miriam squints and purses her lips in concentration, then thinks of
another
<br>thing to debate about. "What are you going to do with the Arabs? Some
of them
<br>won't want you running things. You told me stories about your boyfriend
being
<br>harassed because he wasn't wearing certain pieces of clothing, clothing
he is
<br>supposed to wear under Muslim law but doesn't have to under French
law."
<p>I grow impatient. "This isn't about a homeland for you, Miriam. You
want to know
<br>if she still considers France her home."
<p>The woman blinks. "Perhaps . . . I no longer can consider any place
run by
<br>someone else my home."
<p>Miriam joins in. "Has it gotten this bad? Is Liberty such a joke that
you cannot
<br>stay?"
<p>The woman looks wide-eyed, like she is not sure why Miriam doesn't understand.
<p>The woman driving sighs. "As for the Arabs, they already think we are
just
<br>little Westerners. Cannot win. Perhaps it will take time. Once they
see we are
<br>running things more fairly, better than the French or the Ottomans,
maybe they
<br>will understand. Maybe we could stand to understand them, too. There's
much
<br>about their religion I don't understand. I don't know."
<p>I glance to my right and see the familiar capes and bicycles. "Ladies,
this is a
<br>most intriguing discussion, but there are gendarmerie on our end. Drive
faster."
<p>The woman nods and slaps the horse with her crop, speeding up the cart.
However,
<br>the gendarmerie pedals faster.
<p>Think, now, what can I do to stop them? I see a canister of nails near
the
<br>coffins. Of course. I throw some on the road. One gendarme veers off
the road,
<br>tumbling down near a tree. The second stops when he notices his tire
is flat.
<p>We make a good distance and find ourselves few miles outside of the
train
<br>station. I still crouch between the coffins. How Louis, all of three
years,
<br>keeps still is beyond me. I suspect having his father calms him down.
<p>I had no one down there . . .not now.
<p>What I see next is a nasty surprise. Two well appointed black cars coming
up on
<br>us.
<p>The woman glances over her shoulder and looks at me, eyes wide. "Should
we stop
<br>for them?"
<p>"No."
<p>"You have an idea?" She slaps the horse, moving the cart faster than
before.
<p>I touch my hip and realized I still had my pistol. It is unused, untouched,
and
<br>perhaps a better idea than dynamite. Anything to keep my brother and
my nephew
<br>safe.
<p>I don't have a Jerusalem; I have people who I care about, who I must
protect. If
<br>Timothee needed to leave, I would help him like I am helping Louis
and Richard.
<br>It would hurt as hell like now, too.
<p>Maybe worst.
<p>Now, I am aiming at the tires. "Keep driving," I say, not feeling very
confident
<br>in my aim, but she keeps on.
<p>The first shot gets the left front tire of the first car. It pulls over,
letting
<br>the second car pass. I check the chamber and see there are enough bullets.
I aim
<br>for the tires again.
<p>This time, I shoot the front and back tires. It takes three shots, though.
The
<br>woman is still driving faster. Miriam is pointing and shouting the
way to the
<br>train station.
<p>Then I see a man in grey army uniform run out. He's headed toward us.
He's going
<br>to try to jump the cart.
<p>No.
<p>I have two more bullets and I really don't want to hurt him. I aim for
left
<br>knee. I hear the gunpowder burst, then the man crumpling and groaning
in pain. I
<br>go back into the cart when the woman turns her cart toward a safer
route.
<br>Somehow, we manage to make good speed before the rest of the men in
the cars can
<br>get us.
<p>Finally, we are at the train station, walking on stones and dirt. The
train
<br>hasn't come yet, and somehow I want to say something. "Richard, you
asked me to
<br>come with you. Why? I have . . ."
<p>"You're here, because I want to say good-bye. You've been doing so many
things
<br>that I didn't get a chance until now."
<p>I could never lie to him. "I didn't want to say goodbye, Richard."
<p>"It's not forever." He gives me a firm handshake. "Until we meet again,
Daniel."
<br>He turns quickly, holding Louis' hand. He takes quick steps to the
train
<br>station, occasionally looking of his shoulder.
<p>Louis raises his hand and waves goodbye. I slide into the cart, hidden
by
<br>coffins. Miriam will be transported to the train station to get to
Bolounge, to
<br>pretend none of this happened.
<p>We ride on the cart, taking circuitous routes to prevent being seen
again. When
<br>Miriam and I leave, the woman looks down at me and speaks.
<p>"You call me Nataniah. If anyone you are helping wants to go to
<br>Palestine, send to me. I will get them safe, or at least get them to
someone who
<br>can."
<p>I nod. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I wondered if Leon would go.
He is
<br>already dead I scold myself.
<p>Maybe not. Maybe he is hanging on long enough. Maybe he escaped. Maybe
I am
<br>lying to myself.
<p>It's colder than I thought it was this morning, and the sky is a clear
blue of
<br>winter. Maybe I was in a confessional mood with Miriam leaving. "You
can back
<br>out now," I say to her as we close in on her train station.
<p>"I am thinking about what Nataniah said about doing things better. I
believe we
<br>will win. If we do things better, if we look at our prejudices, I don't
mean
<br>just here, in America maybe, maybe there will be no need for what the
woman is
<br>speaking about, for all that strife I can see if she, if they go ahead
with the
<br>homeland idea. I intend to help us win."
<p>I shrug and Miriam is quiet again. Maybe. I do not know if what she
is saying
<br>will come about. I'm just the composer.
<p>"Maybe it will come about anyway."
<p>I must get to the next safe house, type new love letters. I will see
my friends
<br>again and see how Tim is today. He is okay. They are all okay.
<p>I must not cry. I will see him again. I believe this.
<p>I get bad news when I get to the safe house. This morning, buskers were
given
<br>surprise inspections of permits. In the sweep, Bartek, Tatiana and
Christine
<br>were arrested. Oh shit.
<p>"We're going to rescue them," Avila asks.
<p>"Why not?"
